      "title": "A journey shaped by education",
      "quote": "The work was tough, the environment tougher  -  but those years taught me resilience.",
      "p1": "My working life started in Hobart, Tasmania, with a paintbrush in hand, apprenticing as a painter and decorator while my father ran a small paint factory. After a pre-vocational course at TAFE and a four-year apprenticeship at Cascade Brewery, I realised I wanted more from my work and my education.",
      "p2": "Travel opened my eyes to how big the world really is and how far education can take you. I lived abroad, studied German, and eventually returned to Tasmania to study Administration, Information Systems and German at the University of Tasmania. Graduating with First Class Honours proved I could excel academically despite early doubts and family tensions.",
      "p3": "My career then took me to Brisbane, where I spent six years at Telstra and completed an MBA at the University of Queensland. That MBA opened doors into management roles at UQ, where I became a Business Manager and began publishing research into how people learn, solve problems and think critically in their work.",
      "p4": "It was also in Brisbane that my two daughters, Viola and Solara, were born. Fatherhood reframed everything. Success no longer meant just climbing the next rung of the ladder  -  it meant building a future where work left more time for people, for families and for life. Over time, that desire to create something lasting grew into what would become Zaza Technologies."
