Model: "I'll show you my claim and evidence, then think aloud as I add analysis."
- Claim: "The story's mood shifts to suspense."

## üìä Before/After Examples

### WITHOUT Voice Profile

**Prompt:** "Write a parent email about a student being off-task."

**Output:**
> Dear Mr. Smith,
>
> I am writing to inform you of a concerning behavioral pattern I have observed with regard to your son, Michael. On multiple occasions during the instructional period, Michael has demonstrated a lack of focus and engagement with the assigned tasks. This behavior is impacting his academic progress.
>
> I would appreciate it if you could address this matter at your earliest convenience.
>
> Sincerely,  
> Ms. Johnson

‚ùå Too formal, sounds robotic, no actionable steps

### WITH Voice Profile

**Prompt:** "[Voice Profile Pasted] Write a parent email about a student being off-task."

**Output:**
> Hi Mr. Smith,
>
> I'm reaching out to partner with you about Michael's focus during independent work in English. Today during 4th period, I observed Michael off-task during the writing activity, which meant he didn't finish the organizer. At school, I'll provide a checklist and set a timer tomorrow. At home, a helpful step would be checking that the planner has the daily goal written down. I'll check in by Friday. I respond during school hours within one business day.
>
> Appreciate your support,  
> Ms. Johnson

‚úÖ Sounds like a real teacher, specific, actionable, warm but professional

# SECTION 7: Privacy & Ethics Checklist

## üîí Before You Hit "Generate"

Run through this checklist EVERY time:

### ‚úÖ Safe to Include:
- [ ] Student first names only (no last names)
- [ ] Observable behaviors (not diagnoses)
- [ ] Academic skills and progress
- [ ] General classroom scenarios
- [ ] Template structures

### ‚ùå NEVER Include:
- [ ] Student last names or IDs
- [ ] Medical diagnoses or health conditions
- [ ] Sensitive family information (custody, income, immigration)
- [ ] IEP/504 confidential details beyond public accommodations
- [ ] Any data your district explicitly prohibits

### ü§î When in Doubt:
- Generate the STRUCTURE only (leave details blank)
- Add specific names/info manually in your secure system
- Ask yourself: "Would I be comfortable if this data leaked?"

## üí° Pro Tips for Safe AI Use

**Tip 1:** Use generic placeholders in prompts
- Instead of: "Write an email about Marcus's ADHD"
- Use: "Write an email about a student's focus during independent work"

**Tip 2:** Add details AFTER generation
- Generate: "Hi [Parent Name], I'm reaching out about [Student]'s [topic]..."
- Then manually: Replace [Parent Name] with actual name in your email client

**Tip 3:** Use your district-approved tools first
- If your district provides AI tools, use those for anything with student data
- Use external AI only for generic structures and templates

**Tip 4:** Never copy-paste directly from AI
- Always read, edit, and customize
- Add your specific evidence and observations
- Verify tone and accuracy
