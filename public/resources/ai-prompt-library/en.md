# The Teacher’s AI Prompt Library
*Reusable, reliable prompts + a quick “why this works” guide.*

## The anatomy of a great prompt
- **Role** (who the AI should act as) – “Act as a 5th-grade science teacher…”
- **Task** (what to produce) – “Generate a 10-minute hook…”
- **Constraints** (tone, length, reading level) – “150–180 words, friendly but professional.”
- **Inputs** (paste student work, rubric, unit goals)

> **Pro tip:** Start small → review → tighten constraints.

## A. Parent communication (pick one and paste details)
**Supportive concern (≤150 words)**
> Act as a middle-school teacher. Draft a calm, supportive email to a parent about **[student]** missing **[n]** assignments.  
> Emphasise partnership, include 2 specific next steps and 1 sentence of encouragement. Keep neutral, professional tone.

**Behaviour incident (objective)**
> Act as a teacher writing an objective incident note for **[date/time]**.  
> Include: what was observed (no judgement), impact on learning, action taken, follow-up planned, and a short invitation to talk.

## B. Student feedback (fast & specific)
**Essay feedback (3+1)**
> Provide three encouraging, specific comments and one clear next step on this **[grade/level]** essay.  
> Focus on **thesis clarity**, **evidence**, and **reasoning**. Use student-friendly language (≤60 words total).

**STEM working**
> Give 2 strengths and 1 fix-it about mathematical reasoning. Point to 1 line to improve with a concrete suggestion.

## C. Lesson planning
**Hooks (3 options, one hands-on)**
> Generate 3 engaging hooks for a **[grade/subject]** lesson on **[topic]**.  
> Include duration (≤10 min each), materials, and an accessible question that checks prior knowledge.

**Differentiation ideas**
> For the **[objective]**, give supports for “Approaching”, “Meeting”, and “Extending” learners (sentence stems, visual, challenge).

## D. Rubrics & success criteria
> Rewrite these criteria so students can self-assess (I can… statements). Add a one-line “Next Step” for each criterion.

## E. Time savers
- Turn long instructions into 3-step student checklist.
- Draft 6 retrieval questions from yesterday’s lesson (2 easy, 3 core, 1 stretch).
- Turn a rubric into quick comment bank.

*Zaza Draft tip:* Paste student work + rubric → “highlight 2 strengths, 1 next step, and a model sentence.”
