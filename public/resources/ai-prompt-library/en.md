# The Teacher's AI Prompt Library

_Reusable, reliable prompts + a quick "why this works" guide._

---

## Quick Start Guide

### The anatomy of a great prompt

- **Role** (who the AI should act as) -- "Act as a 5th-grade science teacher..."
- **Task** (what to produce) -- "Generate a 10-minute hook..."
- **Constraints** (tone, length, reading level) -- "150-180 words, friendly but professional."
- **Inputs** (paste student work, rubric, unit goals)

> **Pro tip:** Start small → review → tighten constraints → save what works.

### How to use these prompts

1. **Copy** the prompt exactly as written
2. **Replace** {{placeholders}} with your specific details
3. **Paste** into your AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
4. **Review** the output and refine if needed
5. **Save** successful prompts for reuse

## I. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Generic, textbook answers

**Solution:** Add specific constraints, examples, and context about your actual students

### Problem: Wrong reading level

**Solution:** Specify exact grade level AND add "Use vocabulary appropriate for {{reading level}}"

### Problem: Too long or too short

**Solution:** Give exact word count or time limit. Example: "Maximum 150 words" or "Takes 5 minutes to read"

### Problem: Missing key elements

**Solution:** Use bulleted lists in your prompts. AI follows structure better than paragraphs

### Problem: Doesn't sound like you

**Solution:** Add "Tone: {{conversational / formal / encouraging}}" and give example phrases you use

## Quick Reference: Batch Processing Strategies

**Save time by grouping similar tasks:**

- **Lesson Planning:** Plan entire week at once, save successful prompts as templates
- **Grading:** Grade same assignment across all classes; create rubric first with AI
- **Communication:** Answer emails once daily; write parent updates weekly using templates
- **Materials:** Generate all worksheets for a unit in one session

---

## Building Your Personal Prompt Library

1. **Start small:** Choose 2-3 prompts addressing your biggest time challenges
2. **Test and refine:** Practice with low-stakes content first
3. **Save what works:** Keep a document of your best prompts
4. **Iterate:** Modify prompts based on results
5. **Share:** Exchange successful prompts with colleagues
