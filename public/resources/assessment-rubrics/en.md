# Differentiated Rubric Kit for Common Assignments
*Editable, fair, and learner-friendly rubrics you can adapt in minutes.*

## How to use this kit
- Pick the rubric, adjust criteria to your standards, paste examples, and share with students **before** work begins.
- Use the **student-friendly level language** and add a quick “Next Step” line during feedback.

## Differentiation built in
- Four levels: **Exceeding / Meeting / Approaching / Beginning**
- Add *access supports*: sentence stems, model exemplars, word banks.
- For IEP/ELL learners: allow evidence by **audio/video/graphic** alongside text.

**Tip:** Let students rehearse once with phones as timers; record 30 seconds for self-feedback.

## Group Collaboration (Teacher + Self)

| Criteria | Teacher | Self | Peer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contribution |  |  |  |
| Teamwork |  |  |  |
| Time Management |  |  |  |

**Self-check prompts**  
- “My most helpful contribution this week was …”  
- “One thing I will do differently next time is …”

## Adapting rubrics fast
- Swap criteria (e.g., **Use of Sources**, **Design Quality**) to match task.
- Keep level descriptors **student-facing** (“clear,” “precise”).
- Add **exemplars**: 1 short strong paragraph, 1 developing paragraph.

## Feedback shortcut
Add a “**Next Step**” line under each criterion and circle 1 prompt.  
Examples: *“Add a direct quote and explain how it proves your point.”*, *“Group: decide roles before starting.”*
