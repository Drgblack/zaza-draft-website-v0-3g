# Differentiated Rubric Kit for Common Assignments

_Editable, fair, and learner-friendly rubrics you can adapt in minutes._

## How to use this kit

- Pick the rubric, adjust criteria to your standards, paste examples, and share with students **before** work begins.
- Use the **student-friendly level language** and add a quick â€œNext Stepâ€ line during feedback.

## Differentiation built in

- Four levels: **Exceeding / Meeting / Approaching / Beginning**
- Add _access supports_: sentence stems, model exemplars, word banks.
- For IEP/ELL learners: allow evidence by **audio/video/graphic** alongside text.

## Adapting rubrics fast

- Swap criteria (e.g., **Use of Sources**, **Design Quality**) to match task.
- Keep level descriptors **student-facing** (â€œclear,â€ â€œpreciseâ€).
- Add **exemplars**: 1 short strong paragraph, 1 developing paragraph.

## Feedback shortcut

Add a â€œ**Next Step**â€ line under each criterion and circle 1 prompt.  
Examples: _â€œAdd a direct quote and explain how it proves your point.â€_, _â€œGroup: decide roles before starting.â€_
