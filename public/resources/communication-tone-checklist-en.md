# 🗣️ The Communication Tone Checklist: Professional, Empathetic, Clear

_A comprehensive guide for teachers to strike the right tone in every written and verbal message to students and parents, strengthening relationships sustainably._

---

## 🚀 Quick Start and Core Principles

### How to use this Checklist

1. **Identify the goal of your message** (e.g., resolving a conflict, giving praise, providing information).
2. **Review the relevant checklist points** (Section A for all messages, plus the specific sections B, C, or D).
3. **Check the tone** of your message.
4. **Only send the message** once all points are met and you have passed the **Tone Challenge** (see below).

> **Core Principle:** Communication is relationship building. Your tone is the foundation upon which trust and respect are built. Empathy opens doors, and criticism must be constructive and solution-focused.

## A. General Checklist for All Communication

Regardless of the recipient or medium (email, conversation, note), these core rules ensure a professional and supportive tone.

| Criterion                | Yes/No | Description & Objective                                                                                                                        |
| :----------------------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity & Precision**  | ☐      | Is the main message precise, unambiguous, and free from jargon? The recipient should immediately know what the message is about.               |
| **Courtesy & Structure** | ☐      | Do you begin with an appropriate salutation and end with a clear closing and signature? Structured messages appear respectful.                 |
| **Objectivity & Facts**  | ☐      | Are all emotional, reactive, or interpretative phrases removed? Write based on facts about observed behaviour, not assumed intentions.         |
| **Positive Framing**     | ☐      | Is the message phrased positively wherever possible? Avoid **"not," "never," "must"** – use **"could," "it would be helpful," "the goal is."** |
| **Respect & Equality**   | ☐      | Do you treat the recipient as an equal partner? Avoid condescending or didactic language, even with students.                                  |
| **Proofreading**         | ☐      | Have you checked the message for spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors? Mistakes undermine professionalism and distract from the content.  |

---

### 📝 Exercise: The "Tone Challenge" (Before Sending)

Before sending an email or letter that is critical or highly informative, apply these three tests:

1.  **The Read-Aloud Test:** Read the message out loud. Do you stumble? Does it sound sharp, accusatory, or defensive? If so, rephrase the sentences to be softer and more neutral.
2.  **The Recipient Test:** Read the message from the recipient's perspective. How does the person feel upon reading it? Understood or attacked?
3.  **The Colleague Test:** Would you be comfortable if a colleague read this message? If not, it is likely too personal or emotional.

## B. Communication with Students (Praise & Criticism)

The tone used with students should be **encouraging, appreciative**, and **growth-oriented**.

### Checklist for Praise and Recognition:

| Tone Element                    | Yes/No | How do I apply it?                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------------ | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Specific & Process-Oriented** | ☐      | Praise the **behaviour** and the **effort**, not just intelligence or the outcome. (e.g., _“I saw how much time you put into structuring your presentation,”_ instead of _“You're smart.”_). |
| **Authentic**                   | ☐      | Does the praise sound honest and appropriate? Don't exaggerate; honest, small praise is stronger and more believable.                                                                        |
| **Growth-Oriented**             | ☐      | Connect the praise to the next step (e.g., _“Great job! Now try applying this strategy to the next, more complex task.”_).                                                                   |
| **Public vs. Private**          | ☐      | Is the praise delivered publicly (promotes class community) or privately (encourages introverted students)? Choose deliberately.                                                             |

### Checklist for Feedback and Correction:

_Avoid the "Sandwich Method" (Praise-Critique-Praise), as it makes the praise seem insincere. Instead, get straight to the point, but maintain an appreciative tone._

| Tone Element             | Yes/No | How do I apply it?                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :----------------------- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **'I' Messages**         | ☐      | Speak about your observation and its impact on you/the class, not about the student's character. (e.g., _“I need your focus in the lesson because we are losing time,”_ instead of _“You are constantly disruptive.”_). |
| **Solution-Focused**     | ☐      | Ask questions about the **solution** rather than the blame (e.g., _“What could we both do to ensure your homework is complete next time?”_).                                                                            |
| **Private & Discreet**   | ☐      | Is the criticism or warning delivered confidentially and in private? Public criticism damages dignity and the relationship.                                                                                             |
| **Separating the Issue** | ☐      | Separate the person from the problem. The behaviour was inappropriate, but the person remains valuable and respected.                                                                                                   |

## C. Communication with Parents (Challenging Conversations)

The tone in communication with parents, particularly when dealing with performance, behaviour, or conflict, must be **collaborative, empathetic**, and **professionally detached**.

### Checklist for Critical Parent Communication (Verbal/Written):

| Tone Element                  | Yes/No | Description & Objective                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Show Empathy**              | ☐      | Acknowledge the parents' perspective and feelings (e.g., _“I understand that the situation is worrying for you…”_). This builds trust.                                   |
| **Constructive Intent**       | ☐      | Begin with the common ground and the goal: _“We both want what is best for [Child’s Name] and their success at school.”_ This sets the tone for collaboration.           |
| **Facts, Not Interpretation** | ☐      | Describe only the observed behaviour. State **concrete examples** (when, where, exactly what), rather than using generalisations.                                        |
| **The Power of "Yet"**        | ☐      | Use **growth-oriented language** that conveys hope (e.g., _“[Child] has **not yet** developed the necessary skills.”_).                                                  |
| **Propose Actions**           | ☐      | End the message with a clear **proposal** for the next step or a joint action (e.g., _“I suggest a short meeting to discuss strategies for home and school together.”_). |
| **Avoid Interpretation**      | ☐      | **Avoid diagnoses** or speculation about family circumstances, motivation, or parental intent. Stay within the bounds of your professional observation.                  |

### 🧭 Quick Reference: Phrases for Difficult Conversations

| Topic                | Phrasing that **Fosters Conflict**                              | Phrasing that **Fosters Partnership**                                                                                                       |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Misbehaviour**     | "Your child is constantly disrupting the lesson."               | "I have observed that [Child] has difficulty concentrating in [Situation]. Can we think together about how to support them?"                |
| **Homework**         | "The homework isn't being done, there is a lack of commitment." | "Consistency with homework is currently a challenge. How can we, as a team, ensure that [Child] finds the necessary time and space for it?" |
| **Criticism of You** | "You are mistaken, that is not what happened."                  | "Thank you for the feedback. Just so I understand correctly: You feel that [Repeat parent's perspective]? I want to clarify this."          |
| **Attainment**       | "Your child is not intelligent enough for this class."          | "We see potential for growth in [Child] in [Area]. With targeted support, we can strengthen their foundation."                              |

## D. Email Communication and Formal Messages

Emails are often the first point of contact and must strike the right tone immediately.

### Checklist for Emails:

| Criterion                          | Yes/No | How do I check it?                                                                                                                                    |
| :--------------------------------- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Subject Clear and Specific?**    | ☐      | Is the subject a summary of the content? (e.g., _“Request for meeting: Discussion of Learning Development for Jamie Smith (Year 10)”_).               |
| **Salutation Formal and Correct?** | ☐      | For parents: _Dear Mr/Mrs/Ms [Surname]_. Choose the more formal address if uncertain.                                                                 |
| **One-Thought Paragraphs**         | ☐      | Are paragraphs short and limited to one idea? Long blocks of text feel overwhelming and unfriendly. Use paragraphs for clarity.                       |
| **Courtesy Framing**               | ☐      | Is there an introductory sentence and a concluding, positive sentence (e.g., _“Thank you for your time”_ or _“I look forward to our collaboration”_). |
| **Call to Action (CTA) Clear?**    | ☐      | Is the desired response clear? (e.g., _“Please confirm receipt by Wednesday”_ or _“Please call me”_).                                                 |
| **Tone for Urgency**               | ☐      | For urgent messages: Is the urgency stated factually and not panicky? Use _“Immediate action required”_ instead of _“ASAP!!!”_.                       |

### 💡 Callout: The 24-Hour Rule in Email Communication

To avoid reactive and emotional responses, establish the **24-Hour Rule** for yourself: **Never reply immediately** to emails that annoy or worry you. Read it, write a factual draft response, and only send it 24 hours later. This ensures a professional tone.

---

## E. Prevention and Sustainability

To maintain a healthy communication style long-term, prevention is crucial.

### 📝 Exercise: Five Positive Observations

To improve the ratio of positive to critical communication (ideally 5:1), dedicate 5 minutes per week:

- Write down 5 things you noticed positively about your students this week (not just performance, but kindness, effort, helpfulness).
- Find 5 emails from parents that you have **not** replied to (e.g., thank-you emails) and reply with a short, appreciative sentence (e.g., _“Thank you very much for your feedback, I am delighted to hear that.”_).

### Quick Reference: Tone Shift

| Challenge         | Reflection Question (Before speaking/writing)                                    | Next Step                                                                                           |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frustration**   | What is the emotion behind my frustration? (Anxiety, overwhelm, disappointment?) | Separate the emotion from the task; formulate based purely on facts.                                |
| **Ambiguity**     | What exactly should the recipient do or know in the end?                         | Formulate a clear **Call to Action (CTA)** at the end of the message.                               |
| **Defensiveness** | Why do I feel attacked? Am I hearing a complaint or a concern?                   | Start the reply by **validating** the concern before presenting facts.                              |
| **Lack of Time**  | Can I postpone this information until a later, calmer time?                      | Write a brief reply confirming receipt and stating a **clear deadline** for processing the request. |
