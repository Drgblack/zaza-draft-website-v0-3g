## Quick Start Guide

### How to use this guide

1. **Find your problem** in the contents below
2. **Try the quick fix** first (usually takes under 2 minutes)
3. **If that doesn't work**, move to the detailed solutions
4. **Prevention tips** help you avoid issues in future
5. **Keep this handy** - bookmark or print for easy access during lessons

### Before you start troubleshooting

- ☐ Have you tried turning it off and on again? (Seriously, this works 60% of the time)
- ☐ Are all cables properly connected?
- ☐ Is the device charged or plugged in?
- ☐ Have you checked if other devices have the same problem?

> **Emergency backup plan:** Always have a non-tech alternative ready (printed worksheets, board work, discussion activity)

## A. Internet & Wi-Fi Issues

### Problem: No internet connection / Pages won't load

**Quick Fix (30 seconds):**

1. Check the Wi-Fi icon on your device - is it connected?
2. Try accessing a different website (maybe it's just one site that's down)
3. Ask students if they're having the same problem (helps identify if it's your device or the network)

**Detailed Solutions:**

**If only your device is affected:**

- Turn Wi-Fi off and on again in settings
- Forget the network and reconnect (Settings → Wi-Fi → Select network → Forget)
- Restart your device
- Check you're connected to the correct network (school network, not guest)

**If multiple devices are affected:**

- Check if other classrooms have internet (could be school-wide)
- Restart the classroom router if you have access (unplug for 30 seconds)
- Contact IT support - likely a network issue beyond classroom level

**Common Causes:**

- Too many devices connected to one access point
- Router needs restarting
- Scheduled maintenance or updates
- External provider issues

**Prevention:**

- Know your IT support contact details
- Download essential resources the night before
- Keep offline activities ready as backup
- Test internet connection before lessons start

---

### Problem: Internet is very slow

**Quick Fix (1 minute):**

1. Close unnecessary tabs and applications
2. Ask students to close apps they're not using
3. Pause any downloads or updates

**Detailed Solutions:**

- Disconnect devices that aren't currently needed
- Check if someone is streaming video - this uses massive bandwidth
- Move closer to the Wi-Fi router if using a laptop
- Use wired ethernet connection if available (much faster and more stable)
- Download videos before lessons rather than streaming

**Prevention:**

- Limit the number of devices connected simultaneously
- Schedule downloads during off-peak times
- Use lower-resolution videos when possible
- Cache or download frequently used resources

---

## B. Interactive Whiteboard / Smart Board Problems

### Problem: Touch isn't working / Board not responding

**Quick Fix (2 minutes):**

1. Check the USB cable connection at both ends (board and computer)
2. Look for a flashing light on the board (shows it's powered)
3. Restart the computer whilst the board stays connected

**Detailed Solutions:**

- **Recalibrate the board:**
  - Open the smart board software (SMART Notebook, Promethean, etc.)
  - Find 'Orient' or 'Calibrate' in settings
  - Follow the on-screen instructions to touch target points
  - This usually fixes 90% of touch issues

- **Check connections:**
  - USB cable firmly connected
  - Power cable plugged in (if board has separate power)
  - Try a different USB port on the computer

- **Software issues:**
  - Update board software/drivers
  - Reinstall board software if persistent issues
  - Check the software is running (look for icon in taskbar)

**Prevention:**

- Calibrate the board weekly
- Don't let cables dangle where they can be pulled
- Clean the board surface regularly (removes dust that affects touch)
- Train students to touch gently, not press hard

---

### Problem: Board image is fuzzy or distorted

**Quick Fix:**

- Adjust the projector focus ring
- Check the projector lens isn't dirty

**Detailed Solutions:**
