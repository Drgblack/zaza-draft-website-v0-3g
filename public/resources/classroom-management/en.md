# The Reset Routine: A Proactive Classroom Management Guide
*Calm, consistent routines that protect learning time.*

## Why this guide
A predictable start and a few low-effort interventions prevent 80% of disruptions. Use this guide to set routines, redirect non-compliance without power struggles, and script difficult moments.

## 1) First 5 Minutes: a consistent opening
**Goal:** Every learner is engaged within 60 seconds.

**Setup checklist**
- *Greet at the door* (names if possible). Quick scan for mood/materials.
- *Do Now visible* (on screen/board) and **doable in 3–5 min**.
- *Timer running* before students enter.
- *Materials ready* (tray per table or bins).
- *Attendance* during Do Now; circulate.

**Starter bank (pick one)**
- Retrieval questions (2–3 quick Qs from last lesson)
- Model & label (copy a correct example; highlight key step)
- Silent sort/match (cards on desks; students match pairs)
- Estimation or prediction prompt

**Transition script (10–15s)**
> “When the timer ends: pencils down, eyes front. We’ll check #2 together.”

## 2) Non-verbal interventions that don’t stop teaching
Use *private, brief, consistent* signals before verbal redirection.

| Signal | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Proximity** | drift closer | Keep teaching while you move |
| **Pause** | 2–3s silence | Wait for attention to return |
| **Name on board** | remind expectations | no commentary |
| **Cue card** | visual reminder | “Phone away” card on desk |
| **Tap & point** | to instruction | point at Do Now / rubric |

> **Rule:** If a non-verbal works, don’t add a lecture.

## 3) Co-creating expectations (15–20 min mini-lesson)
**Goal:** 3–5 positive, observable rules.
- Ask: “What does great learning *look/sound* like here?”
- Build a T-chart from student examples.
- Finalise rules and *examples for each rule*.
- Post the chart; revisit weekly (2 minutes).

**Rule examples (observable)**
- “Phones in bags unless asked.”
- “One voice at a time.”
- “We start with Do Now.”

## 4) When a moment escalates: short scripts
**Defiance →** keep direction clear, emotion low  
> “I hear you. We’ll talk after **[time]**. For now, the direction is **[X]**.”

**Disengagement →** get them started  
> “Let’s do the first one together—then you try the next.”

**Side-talk →** redirect the behaviour, not the person  
> “Voices off. Track the speaker.”

**Safety line** (if needed)  
> “We’re pausing. Step outside the door; I’ll join you in 30 seconds.”

## 5) Corrective routine (2–4 min) instead of confrontation
1. Name the routine: “Reset: track, tools out, voices off.”
2. Micro-rehearse (10–15 seconds).
3. Re-start instruction immediately.

## 6) Track just enough data (1 page)
- **Start-of-lesson on-time %** (weekly trend)
- **Redirects** (✔ for non-verbal, V for verbal)
- **Follow-ups** (1–2 names + actions)

## 7) Family communication (ready-to-send mini-notes)
**Positive:**  
> “Quick update—X led the group discussion today with thoughtful points. Great progress in speaking with confidence.”

**Concern (neutral):**  
> “X missed today’s starter and needed two reminders to begin. Can you ask them to look for the Do Now immediately next lesson?”
