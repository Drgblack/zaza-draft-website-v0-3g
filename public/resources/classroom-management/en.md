# The Reset Routine: A Proactive Classroom Management Guide

_Calm, consistent routines that protect learning time._

## Why this guide

A predictable start and a few low-effort interventions prevent 80% of disruptions. Use this guide to set routines, redirect non-compliance without power struggles, and script difficult moments.

## 1) First 5 Minutes: a consistent opening

**Goal:** Every learner is engaged within 60 seconds.

**Setup checklist**

- _Greet at the door_ (names if possible). Quick scan for mood/materials.
- _Do Now visible_ (on screen/board) and **doable in 3-5 min**.
- _Timer running_ before students enter.
- _Materials ready_ (tray per table or bins).
- _Attendance_ during Do Now; circulate.

**Starter bank (pick one)**

- Retrieval questions (2-3 quick Qs from last lesson)
- Model & label (copy a correct example; highlight key step)
- Silent sort/match (cards on desks; students match pairs)
- Estimation or prediction prompt

**Transition script (10-15s)**

> "When the timer ends: pencils down, eyes front. We'll check #2 together."

## 2) Non-verbal interventions that don't stop teaching

Use _private, brief, consistent_ signals before verbal redirection.

| Signal            | Use                 | Example                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Proximity**     | drift closer        | Keep teaching while you move |
| **Pause**         | 2-3s silence        | Wait for attention to return |
| **Name on board** | remind expectations | no commentary                |
| **Cue card**      | visual reminder     | "Phone away" card on desk    |
| **Tap & point**   | to instruction      | point at Do Now / rubric     |

> **Rule:** If a non-verbal works, don't add a lecture.

## 3) Co-creating expectations (15-20 min mini-lesson)

**Goal:** 3-5 positive, observable rules.

- Ask: "What does great learning _look/sound_ like here?"
- Build a T-chart from student examples.
- Finalise rules and _examples for each rule_.
- Post the chart; revisit weekly (2 minutes).

**Rule examples (observable)**

- "Phones in bags unless asked."
- "One voice at a time."
- "We start with Do Now."

## 4) When a moment escalates: short scripts

**Defiance â†’** keep direction clear, emotion low

> "I hear you. We'll talk after **[time]**. For now, the direction is **[X]**."

**Disengagement â†’** get them started

> "Let's do the first one together-then you try the next."

**Side-talk â†’** redirect the behaviour, not the person

> "Voices off. Track the speaker."

**Safety line** (if needed)

> "We're pausing. Step outside the door; I'll join you in 30 seconds."

## 5) Corrective routine (2-4 min) instead of confrontation

1. Name the routine: "Reset: track, tools out, voices off."
2. Micro-rehearse (10-15 seconds).
3. Re-start instruction immediately.

## 6) Track just enough data (1 page)

- **Start-of-lesson on-time %** (weekly trend)
- **Redirects** (âœ” for non-verbal, V for verbal)
- **Follow-ups** (1-2 names + actions)

## 7) Family communication (ready-to-send mini-notes)

**Positive:**

> "Quick update-X led the group discussion today with thoughtful points. Great progress in speaking with confidence."

**Concern (neutral):**

> "X missed today's starter and needed two reminders to begin. Can you ask them to look for the Do Now immediately next lesson?"
