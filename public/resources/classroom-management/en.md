# The Reset Routine: A Proactive Classroom Management Guide

_Calm, consistent routines that protect learning time._

## Why this guide

A predictable start and a few low-effort interventions prevent 80% of disruptions. Use this guide to set routines, redirect non-compliance without power struggles, and script difficult moments.

## 1) First 5 Minutes: a consistent opening

**Goal:** Every learner is engaged within 60 seconds.

**Setup checklist**

- _Greet at the door_ (names if possible). Quick scan for mood/materials.
- _Do Now visible_ (on screen/board) and **doable in 3-5 min**.
- _Timer running_ before students enter.
- _Materials ready_ (tray per table or bins).
- _Attendance_ during Do Now; circulate.

**Starter bank (pick one)**

- Retrieval questions (2-3 quick Qs from last lesson)
- Model & label (copy a correct example; highlight key step)
- Silent sort/match (cards on desks; students match pairs)
- Estimation or prediction prompt

**Transition script (10-15s)**

> â€œWhen the timer ends: pencils down, eyes front. Weâ€™ll check #2 together.â€

## 2) Non-verbal interventions that donâ€™t stop teaching

Use _private, brief, consistent_ signals before verbal redirection.

| Signal            | Use                 | Example                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Proximity**     | drift closer        | Keep teaching while you move |
| **Pause**         | 2-3s silence        | Wait for attention to return |
| **Name on board** | remind expectations | no commentary                |
| **Cue card**      | visual reminder     | â€œPhone awayâ€ card on desk    |
| **Tap & point**   | to instruction      | point at Do Now / rubric     |

> **Rule:** If a non-verbal works, donâ€™t add a lecture.

## 3) Co-creating expectations (15-20 min mini-lesson)

**Goal:** 3-5 positive, observable rules.

- Ask: â€œWhat does great learning _look/sound_ like here?â€
- Build a T-chart from student examples.
- Finalise rules and _examples for each rule_.
- Post the chart; revisit weekly (2 minutes).

**Rule examples (observable)**

- â€œPhones in bags unless asked.â€
- â€œOne voice at a time.â€
- â€œWe start with Do Now.â€

## 4) When a moment escalates: short scripts

**Defiance â†’** keep direction clear, emotion low

> â€œI hear you. Weâ€™ll talk after **[time]**. For now, the direction is **[X]**.â€

**Disengagement â†’** get them started

> â€œLetâ€™s do the first one together-then you try the next.â€

**Side-talk â†’** redirect the behaviour, not the person

> â€œVoices off. Track the speaker.â€

**Safety line** (if needed)

> â€œWeâ€™re pausing. Step outside the door; Iâ€™ll join you in 30 seconds.â€

## 5) Corrective routine (2-4 min) instead of confrontation

1. Name the routine: â€œReset: track, tools out, voices off.â€
2. Micro-rehearse (10-15 seconds).
3. Re-start instruction immediately.

## 6) Track just enough data (1 page)

- **Start-of-lesson on-time %** (weekly trend)
- **Redirects** (âœ” for non-verbal, V for verbal)
- **Follow-ups** (1-2 names + actions)

## 7) Family communication (ready-to-send mini-notes)

**Positive:**

> â€œQuick update-X led the group discussion today with thoughtful points. Great progress in speaking with confidence.â€

**Concern (neutral):**

> â€œX missed todayâ€™s starter and needed two reminders to begin. Can you ask them to look for the Do Now immediately next lesson?â€
