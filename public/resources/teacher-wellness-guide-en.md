# 🍎 Teacher Wellness Guide: Sustaining Your Passion for Teaching

_Sustainable strategies for managing stress, preventing burnout, and maintaining your passion for teaching._

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### How to use this guide

1. **Find your challenge** in the contents below.
2. **Try the Quick Wins** first (usually take under 5 minutes).
3. **Explore the Detailed Strategies** for long-term success.
4. **Prevention Tips** help you avoid stress traps in the future.
5. **Keep this handy** – use it as a reminder and motivator.

### Before you shift into stress mode

- ☐ Have you taken a deep breath and paused briefly today? (A mini-reset works wonders.)
- ☐ Is this task genuinely urgent NOW? Or just important?
- ☐ Can you delegate or simplify this task?
- ☐ Have you met your own basic needs (food, drink, break)?

> **Emergency backup plan for the soul:** Always have a non-work activity ready that brings you immediate joy (a song, a short walk, a quick call to a friend).

## A. Reducing Mental Load

### Problem: Mind is full – constantly brooding over tasks

**Quick Win (3 minutes):**

1. Do a **Brain Dump**: Write down everything running through your head (marking, parents' evening admin, resources).
2. Triage the list: Decide what needs to be tackled **today** and what can wait.
3. Put the list away – your brain knows the information is safe.

**Detailed Strategies:**

- **Batching:** Group similar tasks together (e.g., all emails only once a day, all marking in one dedicated block).
- **The 'Entry Rule':** Any new task that pops into your head is immediately written onto your brain dump list or calendar, not stored in your memory.
- **Weekly Review:** Schedule a short session (15 mins) on Friday to overview the coming week and set priorities, allowing you a clear weekend.

**Common Causes of Mental Load:**

- Lack of structure and fixed routines
- Attempting to remember every single task
- Unclear boundaries between work and private life

**Prevention:**

- Use a single, reliable system for all tasks (_To-Do app, notebook_).
- Start the day with the most important, difficult task (_Eat the Frog_).
- Delegate small tasks to _student helpers_ (e.g., handing out, cleaning the board).

### Problem: Perfectionism consumes time and energy

**Quick Win (1 minute):**

1. Define the point of **'Good Enough'** for your next task (e.g., lesson planning).
2. Stick to it.

**Detailed Strategies:**

- **Prioritise: Less is More:** Reduce the complexity of your resources. _Does_ the worksheet really need to be in colour? _Do_ all slides need to be perfectly designed?
- **Recycling:** Reuse your materials from last year – without over-analysing them! Save your perfection for emergencies.
- **The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle):** 80% of the results come from 20% of your effort. Identify the 20% (core message, clear structure) and stop when reached.

## B. Embedding Self-Care into the School Day

### Problem: No time for breaks – constantly working through

**Quick Win (5 minutes):**

1. Set a timer to remind you to **stand up** every 60–90 minutes.
2. Step outside briefly or stretch.

**Detailed Strategies:**

- **Lunch Break Rule:** Leave the staffroom if it is too loud or stressful. Go for a short walk, listen to a podcast, or eat alone. **No marking** during the lunch break!
- **The 'Buffer Principle':** Consciously schedule a 15-minute buffer between the last lesson and the start of afternoon tasks. This is for recovery, not for work.
- **Micro-Recovery:** Practice short mindfulness exercises during lessons, e.g., while students are working independently (2 minutes of breathing exercises).

**Prevention:**

- Commit to only two cups of coffee and drink water instead – dehydration exacerbates exhaustion.
- Book firm **Self-Care appointments** in your diary (e.g., exercise, reading) and treat them like a staff meeting.

### Problem: Lack of sleep and chronic exhaustion

**Quick Win:**

- Switch off all screens (laptop, phone) two hours before bedtime.

**Detailed Strategies:**

- **Sleep Routine:** Maintain a fixed bedtime, even at weekends.
- **Winding Down:** Find a ritual (tea, book, bath) that signals to your body that the working day is over.
- **No School Thoughts after 9 p.m.:** Write down anything that comes to mind on a sticky note for the next morning and consciously dedicate yourself to something else.

---

## C. Effective Time and Energy Management

### Problem: Tasks always take longer than planned

**Quick Win (2 minutes):**

1. Take on the most difficult marking task.
2. Mark for **only 20 minutes** (use the Pomodoro technique).
3. Take a 5-minute break. Repeat.

**Detailed Strategies:**

- **Fixed Time Slots:** Define blocks for tasks instead of defining tasks (e.g., _1 hour of marking_ instead of _Mark all books_). When the time is up, stop.
- **Simplifying Marking:** Develop standardised comments or abbreviations for marking **assessments** or **exams**. Use sample marking where pedagogically justifiable.
- **Themed Days:** Reserve days for specific tasks (e.g., Tuesday = Planning, Thursday = Parent Communication).

**Prevention:**

- Estimate the time required for tasks honestly and always add 20% more time.
- Keep a **Time Log** for one week to see where your hours are actually disappearing.

## D. Healthy Boundaries and Communication

### Problem: Constant availability via emails or school messengers

**Quick Win (30 seconds):**

- Disable all school notifications on your personal mobile phone.

**Detailed Strategies:**

- **Communicate Your Availability:** Clearly inform parents and students when you read and reply to emails (e.g., _I read and reply to emails on weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. No processing takes place at weekends or on public holidays._).
- **The 24/48-Hour Rule:** Do not reply immediately. Aim to reply to emails within 24 or 48 hours, not within 5 minutes.
- **Automated Out-of-Office Reply:** Use the auto-reply to refer to your communication rules, especially during holidays.

**Prevention:**

- Set up a **Time Block** in your timetable (or at the end of the day) exclusively for emails and admin.
- Be friendly but firm in enforcing your boundaries. You are a teacher, not a 24/7 customer service.

## E. Preserving the Joy of Teaching

### Problem: Motivation wanes, routine is overwhelming

**Quick Win (1 minute):**

- Think about the biggest success of the past week – a student 'Aha!' moment, a successful lesson. Write it down.

**Detailed Strategies:**

- **What am I here for?** Write down your **three core values** that motivated you to teach (e.g., _Imparting knowledge, building relationships, fostering creativity_). Review weekly whether your work reflects these values.
- **Small Experiments:** Incorporate a new, small element into the lesson (a new method, a game, a short story) that you enjoy.
- **Networking:** Regularly exchange ideas with positive, supportive colleagues (Seek out **motivators** instead of **complainers**).
- **Celebrate Successes:** Acknowledge your own efforts. The end of every **unit of work** or **grade submission** is a success – celebrate it, even alone.

---

## F. Prevention & Sustainability

### Daily Routines (5 minutes)

**At the end of the school day:**

- ☐ Close all school-related apps on your mobile phone.
- ☐ Write down the most important task for tomorrow (the _Frog_).
- ☐ Pack your bag only with things you **actually** need at home (e.g., no marking that can wait).
- ☐ Tidy your desk to start the next day calmly.

### Weekly Maintenance (10 minutes)

- ☐ **Weekly Review** on Friday: What went well? What can be dropped next week?
- ☐ Check if you have kept your planned **Self-Care appointments**.
- ☐ Block out an hour for preparing meals (_Meal Prep_) to save time during the week.
- ☐ Check your boundaries: Where did you say _Yes_ when you meant _No_?

### Monthly Tasks

- ☐ **Establish Cover Lesson Boxes:** Create ready-made, simple materials for a cover lesson (e.g., films with questions, puzzles, reading tasks) to avoid acute stress during illness.
- ☐ **Seek Support:** Do not hesitate to consider **supervision** or a coach if the workload becomes chronic.
- ☐ **Remember the 'Why' Moment:** Your profession is important, but it is not everything. The greatest commitment is only sustainable if you protect yourself.
