  "about.company.body.p2":

    "Throughout my PhD research in professional education, I focused on how learners develop critical thinking and problem solving in real-world environments. I have seen how technology can support learning when it is used well. I have also seen how easily it can add stress, waste time, or work against what educators are trying to achieve.",
  "founder.journey.p2":
    "As Chief Learning Officer at Communardo, I lead work in AI-powered learning design, digital content development, LMS innovation, and teacher training. I've written and spoken widely on learning science, eLearning strategy, and the role of AI in education.",
  "founder.journey.p3":
    "But here's the truth: Most edtech tools aren't built for teachers. They're built for sales meetings.",
  "founder.journey.p4":
    "I've watched technology sold as 'revolutionary' only to become another system teachers must manage. I've seen AI products that generate content that looks impressive at first glance-but collapses the moment a teacher tries to use it with real students.",
