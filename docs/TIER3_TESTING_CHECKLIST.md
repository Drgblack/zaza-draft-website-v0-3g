analytics.aiLiteracy.viewCourse(courseId, courseTitle)
analytics.aiLiteracy.downloadResource(resourceName)
analytics.aiLiteracy.selectCertificationPath(pathName)
\`\`\`

### Webinars Events
\`\`\`javascript
analytics.webinars.viewHub()
analytics.webinars.registerWebinar(webinarId, webinarTitle)
analytics.webinars.watchRecording(webinarId, webinarTitle)
analytics.webinars.filterByCategory(category)
\`\`\`

### Community Events
\`\`\`javascript
analytics.community.viewHub()
analytics.community.viewCategory(categoryName)
analytics.community.viewDiscussion(discussionId, discussionTitle)
\`\`\`

### Glossary Events
\`\`\`javascript
analytics.glossary.viewHub()
analytics.glossary.viewTerm(termId, termName)

## 10. Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Lead magnet form doesn't actually send emails (requires backend integration)
- Some course/webinar/discussion pages are placeholder links
- Analytics events log to console in development (production will use actual analytics service)

### Future Enhancements
- Add A/B testing framework for conversion elements
- Implement actual email capture backend
- Add more granular analytics (scroll depth, time on page, etc.)
- Create admin dashboard for analytics visualization
