PROMPT
You are Codex working in:
C:\Users\User\zaza-draft-website-v0-3g

Goal:
Implement the PR10 “Website copy pack (EN/DE)” into the actual Next.js website pages, with strict EN/DE parity.

Source of truth (already copied into this repo):
docs/website-copy/HOMEPAGE_EN.md
docs/website-copy/HOMEPAGE_DE.md
docs/website-copy/FAQ_EN.md
docs/website-copy/FAQ_DE.md
docs/website-copy/PRICING_EN.md
docs/website-copy/PRICING_DE.md
docs/website-copy/PRIVACY_TRUST_EN.md
docs/website-copy/PRIVACY_TRUST_DE.md

Hard constraints:

Preserve the existing design system/components. Keep diffs minimal.

No em dashes in new copy (run pnpm guard:no-emdash or pnpm guard:all if available).

EN/DE parity: both languages must be updated in the same PR.

Do not touch the app repo. Only change this website repo.

Tasks:

Locate where the homepage content currently lives (likely app/page.tsx or src pages). Wire in the new EN/DE homepage copy.

Locate or create pages/routes for:

/faq

/pricing

/privacy (or /privacy-trust)
Use the corresponding EN/DE markdown content.

If the site uses MD/MDX rendering, use the existing pattern. If it uses hardcoded React components, port the copy carefully.

Ensure navigation links (header/footer) point to these pages and work in both locales.

Run:

pnpm lint

pnpm typecheck

pnpm build

pnpm guard:all (if present)

Commit and open a PR.
