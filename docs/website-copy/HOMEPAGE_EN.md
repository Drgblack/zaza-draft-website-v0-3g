## How it works

Upload your situation, choose a tone, and Zaza Draft rewrites it with the target parent, student, and teacher details highlighted. The response includes a greeting, body, and signature tuned to your locale, plus usage and trust-grade metadata for your records.

## Trust-grade safety

Every draft is checked against Appendix F phrases before you see it. If a phrase is blocked, the API returns the structured `INVALID_REQUEST` response with localized guidance so you can rephrase without losing flow.

## Designed for Sunday night anxiety

Zaza Draft is the calm partner when the weekend ends: quiet copy, precise signatures, and reassuring tone. It keeps the Sunday-night worry buttoned up so you can get rest before Monday.
