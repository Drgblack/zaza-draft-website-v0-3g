# Pricing (EN)

Zaza Draft is currently in pilot mode. The pricing page will list final rates soon, but here is how we plan to keep it fair:

- **Free plan:** Includes a fair monthly usage allowance with clear caps enforced via structured `RATE_LIMITED` responses. Perfect for individual teachers exploring the workflow.
- **Pro plan:** Unlocks higher limits, priority safety reviews, and dedicated onboarding support. Pricing will be announced shortly - _Insert price here_ per teacher per month.
- **Custom / school agreements:** Large teams can reach out via the support channel to discuss tailored blocks and rollout timing.

We keep the experience transparent: the UI shows your current usage, remaining drafts, and plan so you always know where you stand.
