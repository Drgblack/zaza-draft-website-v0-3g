Most teachers hear two extreme messages about AI. One says paste nothing and avoid the tools. The other says paste everything and move faster. Both are unhelpful.

The middle path is simple. Use AI where it saves time and helps learning, while keeping personal or sensitive data out.

This guide explains school-safe data in plain English. You will learn what to paste, what to keep out, and how to speak with vendors without jargon. There is a bank of questions you can use, quick classroom scenarios, and a full 45-minute lesson to teach safe choices to students.

The goal is trust. When people understand the boundaries, AI becomes easier to use and safer for everyone.

## What This Means for Teachers

> **From research and classroom practice, translated for everyday use**
>
> - Start with purpose. Share only the data the task needs
> - Use worked examples and generic prompts to reduce risk and cognitive load
> - Short, routine checks build good habits. Long policy documents do not
> - Dialogue and quick feedback help more than late written rules
> - Keep a simple record of important prompts and decisions

## 1) The Basics in Plain English

**Privacy**  
Who can see the data and for what reason.

**Security**  
How data is protected from the wrong people or mistakes.

**Compliance**  
Rules your school must follow, such as GDPR. Think consent, retention, and the right to access or delete.

**Retention**  
How long data is kept. Short is safer unless there is a clear reason to keep it.

**Logs**  
A simple list of what happened and when. Useful for audits and to improve practice.

**Teacher micro-script**

> "We use the least data needed. We avoid names and identifiers. If we are unsure, we remove or change the detail before we paste."

**Low-prep activity: Data or no data**  
Write five short snippets on cards. Students hold up green for safe to paste, amber for check, red for do not paste.

Examples:

- **Green**: a generic success criterion, a model answer with no names
- **Amber**: a summary of a classroom incident with no names
- **Red**: full student name with behaviour notes

**Quick check**  
Ask two students to turn one red card into green by removing or changing details.

## 2) What to Paste and What to Keep Out

### Green List - Usually Safe

- Generic topics and tasks
- Success criteria and rubrics
- Model answers with no names
- Public domain facts and texts
- Generic misconceptions and feedback phrases

### Amber List - Check First

- Class level data with no names
- Paraphrased notes from a lesson
- Draft parent updates with no identifiers
- Any content that, when combined, could point to a child

### Red List - Do Not Paste

- Names, emails, addresses, dates of birth
- Health, safeguarding, or SEND details
- Grades linked to a child
- Anything that could harm a child if leaked or misused

**Teacher micro-script**

> "If it is about a person, we keep it out. If we can teach the same idea with a generic version, we do that."

**Low-prep activity: Greenify it**  
Give pairs a red snippet. Their job is to rewrite it as a green snippet that still serves the learning goal.

**Quick check**  
Cold call: "What was the learning goal and how did you keep it while removing risk?"

## 3) Ten Vendor Questions Teachers Can Actually Use

Use these before you say yes to a new tool. You do not need legal language. Ask for clear, written answers.

1. **Do you process personal data or can we use the tool without it?**
2. **Where is data stored and processed?**
3. **How long do you keep data and can we set retention to a short period?**
4. **Can we delete data on request within a set time?**
5. **Do you use our data to train your models?**
6. **Can we opt out of training use?**
7. **Do you provide an audit log for prompts and outputs?**
8. **What encryption do you use in transit and at rest?**
9. **Do you support school accounts and role-based access?**
10. **What happens if there is a breach and how will you notify us?**

**Teacher micro-script for vendors**

> "Our priority is pupil safety and staff workload. Please answer in plain English and confirm in writing. If you need personal data for a feature, explain why and how we can switch it off."

**Quick check**  
If the vendor cannot answer in plain English, treat it as a warning. Ask for a simpler explanation in writing.

## 4) Classroom Scenarios You Will Actually Face

### Scenario A: Parent Email Draft

You want help drafting a calm reply.

- **Safe move**: paste the core issue in generic terms and ask for a neutral, short template
- **Unsafe move**: paste the parent name, the child name, and the incident details

### Scenario B: Differentiated Examples

You want three versions of an explanation.

- **Safe move**: paste the topic and success criteria
- **Unsafe move**: paste a past student answer with identifiers

### Scenario C: Translation for Home

You want a parent note in another language.

- **Safe move**: paste a generic note with no names, then review the translation
- **Unsafe move**: paste a long email thread with sensitive details

### Scenario D: Behaviour Reflection

You want a restorative prompt list.

- **Safe move**: ask for neutral question stems that fit your policy
- **Unsafe move**: paste a full behaviour log with dates and names

**Low-prep activity: Go, Change, No**  
Students or staff label each scenario as Go, Go with changes, or No. Then they rewrite the risky examples to make them safe.

**Quick check**  
"What single change made the biggest difference to safety and why?"

## 5) A Simple Audit Habit That Takes 2 Minutes

You do not need a heavy system. Keep a short note for any use that shapes learning or communication.

### Log Template

- **Date and class**
- **Prompt purpose**
- **Was any personal data pasted?** Yes or No
- **Key output used**
- **Follow up if needed**

**Teacher micro-script**

> "This helps us improve the quality of prompts and keeps a basic trail. It takes two minutes and prevents issues."

## 6) A 45-Minute Lesson You Can Copy Tomorrow

**Goal**: Students learn to choose safe inputs for AI and justify their choices.

**Materials**: Mini whiteboards, five scenario cards, timer, projector.

### Plan

**Minutes 0-5: Hook**  
Show two prompts. One safe, one unsafe.  
**Micro-script**: "Which is safer and why? We are learning how to decide."

**Minutes 5-12: Teach the Basics**  
Explain privacy, security, compliance, retention, and logs in one line each.  
Green, amber, red lists on the board.  
**Quick check**: students sort three quick examples.

**Minutes 12-22: Scenario Sort**  
Groups get five scenario cards. They label Go, Change, or No.  
They rewrite one No into a Go.  
**Teacher move**: check language, press for justification.

**Minutes 22-32: Worked Example Remix**  
Model how to turn a messy prompt into a safe, useful one.  
Show before and after with reasons.  
**Student action**: pairs do the same with a new card.

**Minutes 32-40: Whole-Class Feedback**  
Board headings: What worked, Common fixes, Next steps.  
Students add one fix to their prompt.

**Minutes 40-45: Exit Ticket**  
Students write one safe prompt for a chosen task and one sentence that explains the safety choice.

### Years 5-6 Variant

- Keep scenarios simple and concrete
- Provide sentence stems such as "We removed names because..."
- Use traffic light cards for quick checks

### Years 9-10 Variant

- Add role play. One student is the vendor, one the teacher
- Include one question from the vendor list and a follow-up

## 7) Mini-Rubric Students Can Own

### Protects Privacy

- **Novice**: includes identifiers or private detail
- **Secure**: removes identifiers but keeps context
- **Strong**: removes identifiers and reduces detail to the minimum needed

### Uses Data Wisely

- **Novice**: pastes more than the task requires
- **Secure**: shares only what the task needs
- **Strong**: shares minimal data and explains the choice clearly

## 8) Classroom Assets You Can Copy

### One-Page Checklist

- Green, amber, red examples
- Vendor question bank
- Audit log template
- Prompt rewrite steps

### Short Script for Parents or Leaders

> "We use AI to speed up routine tasks and improve learning. We avoid personal data and keep prompts generic. We check accuracy and tone before we use an output. We keep short notes of key prompts. This saves time while protecting privacy."

## 9) How AI Helps Without Risk

Use **Zaza Draft** to:

- **Rewrite success criteria** in plain student language
- **Generate strong, secure, and developing model answers** with no names
- **Draft parent updates** from generic notes, then review and personalise offline if needed

_Safety note_  
Keep names and sensitive facts out of prompts. If you must personalise, do it after AI has created the generic text.

## Building Data Confidence

The key to safe AI use in schools is developing good data habits rather than perfect knowledge of regulations. Most teachers need practical guidelines, not legal expertise.

Start with the Green-Amber-Red classification. Use it consistently for a fortnight. Students and colleagues will quickly internalise the boundaries.

Remember: the safest approach isn't always the most useful one. The goal is finding the sweet spot where AI genuinely helps teaching and learning while keeping personal information protected.

## Common Data Dilemmas

### "My AI tool needs examples to give good feedback"

Create generic examples that demonstrate the same learning points without using real student work. This often produces better teaching materials anyway.

### "Parents want to know exactly what data we're using"

The one-page checklist and parent script provide clear, jargon-free explanations. Transparency builds trust more than technical detail.

### "Our school has no AI policy yet"

Start with these practical guidelines. Document what works. This real-world evidence helps shape sensible school policies.

### "I'm worried about making mistakes"

Perfect isn't the goal. Progress is. Each careful choice builds better habits and reduces risk over time.

## The Bigger Picture

School-safe AI isn't just about following rules. It's about modelling digital citizenship and critical thinking for the next generation.

When students learn to evaluate data sharing decisions, they develop skills they'll need throughout their lives. The classroom becomes a laboratory for responsible technology use.

The principles in this guide apply beyond AI tools. They're fundamental practices for any digital environment where learning happens.

## Getting Started This Week

1. **Try the Green-Amber-Red sorting** with one real prompt you want to use
2. **Ask one vendor question** from the list and note the response quality
3. **Keep one simple log entry** for an AI task you complete
4. **Teach the 45-minute lesson** to build student understanding

Each small step builds confidence and competence. Perfect implementation isn't required. Thoughtful, consistent practice is.

## Looking Forward

Data protection requirements will continue evolving. The principles in this guide will remain constant: minimal sharing, clear purpose, human oversight, and simple documentation.

Build habits now with practical routines. When new regulations or tools emerge, you'll have the framework to evaluate and adapt appropriately.

The goal isn't to eliminate all risk. It's to make informed choices that balance safety with educational benefit.

## Making It Sustainable

Sustainable data practices need to feel natural, not burdensome. The 2-minute audit habit and Green-Amber-Red classification are designed to integrate into existing workflows.

Train students to think about data choices automatically. When they internalise these patterns, they become partners in maintaining safe practices rather than passive recipients of rules.

Remember: data protection is ultimately about protecting people. Keep that human focus central to all technical decisions.
