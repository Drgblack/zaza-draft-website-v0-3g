# Agents In Education: What changes for teachers and how to prepare

You will hear more about **AI agents** this year. People will say they plan lessons, check work, write emails, and book meetings. That can sound like hype.

Here is the teacher-first version in plain English. An agent is software that follows your goal, uses a few tools, and reports back so you can decide. It is more like a careful assistant than a magic box.

My PhD explored critical thinking and problem-solving in student-centred eLearning. The lesson for agents is simple. When we make thinking visible, give worked examples, and keep cognitive load low, students learn more. Agents can help with the routine parts so you can focus on the human work.

Sense making, relationships, wellbeing, and culture stay with you.

## What This Means for Teachers

> **From research to practice**
>
> - Authentic tasks with clear success criteria improve reasoning
> - Worked examples, then guided practice, then independence lowers load
> - Short, routine prompts about thinking lift explanation quality
> - Dialogue and rapid checks beat late, written comments
> - Feedback should change the next attempt, not only the grade

## 1) What Is an AI Agent in Teacher Terms

**A simple definition**  
An agent is a digital helper that tries to reach a goal you set. It can use tools like a calendar, a document, a dataset, or a template. It follows rules you give it and shows you what it did, so you can approve or change the result.

**The five parts of an agent**

1. **Goal** - what you want, for example, "Create three example questions with answers for tomorrow's lesson"
2. **Context** - success criteria, class level, topic, and constraints
3. **Tools** - where it can act, for example, a worksheet folder, a planner, or a safe prompt library
4. **Guardrails** - what it must avoid, for example, no personal data, keep within policy
5. **Review** - your check before anything is used with students or families

**Teacher micro-script**

> "Your job is to draft, not decide. Use only generic class info. Show your steps. I will review before anything is shared."

## 2) Day-in-the-Life with Agents

### Near Term - This Year to 2027

- **Planning**: You ask for three model answers at different levels based on your success criteria
- **Checks**: It drafts a five-question retrieval quiz
- **Comms**: It suggests a short parent update template in calm tone, with no names
- **You do**: choose, edit, and teach. You add whole-class feedback after the lesson

**Teacher micro-script**

> "Draft three versions, Developing, Secure, Strong, for this success criterion. No names. Keep it to 120 words each."

### Medium Term - Around Five Years

- **Planning**: It proposes a lesson outline that matches your scheme of work, with hinge questions and likely misconceptions
- **In lesson**: You press a button to generate a variation for a group that is stuck
- **Assessment**: It clusters exit tickets into common strengths and fixes
- **You do**: decide whether to reteach or move on, capture exemplars, and run the discussion

**Teacher micro-script**

> "Group B needs a scaffolded version with one worked example and one practice. Make the reading level lower. Keep the same concept."

### Longer Term - Around Ten Years

- **Across classes**: It coordinates resources, timings, and quick parent summaries across a year group
- **Support**: It helps with study plans and signposts wellbeing resources
- **You do**: sense making, culture, boundaries, and professional judgement. You own final decisions

**Teacher micro-script**

> "Propose a plan that balances workload and learning. Show trade-offs. I will decide and adapt for our context."

## 3) The DARE Routine for Safe Delegation

A short routine that turns agents into a useful habit.

### D - Define

State the goal, constraints, success criteria, and what to avoid.  
**Teacher micro-script**

> "Goal: three model paragraphs on theme. Constraints: Year 9 reading level, British English, 120 words. Avoid personal data, avoid quotes from paid sources."

### A - Approve

Ask the agent to show a small sample first.  
**Teacher micro-script**

> "Show one sample before you continue. I will approve or adjust."

### R - Review

Check accuracy, bias, clarity, and fit for your class.  
**Teacher micro-script**

> "This is close. Replace the second sentence with a clearer link to the criterion. Then generate the other two."

### E - Edit

Make the final call, trim, and add your voice.  
**Teacher micro-script**

> "Use the Secure version. Add our sentence stem list at the top. Save it to the lesson folder."

**Low-prep activity: DARE cards**  
Give students four small cards labelled D, A, R, E. When you model delegation on the visualiser, they hold up the card that matches your current step. This helps them learn the flow for their own projects later.

**Quick check**  
Cold call: "What did I change at the Review step and why did it matter?"

## 4) Guardrails That Keep You in Charge

**Risk areas to watch**

- **Personal data** - names, emails, behaviour or health notes
- **Fabrication** - the agent invents a source or detail
- **Bias** - narrow examples or unfair assumptions
- **Tone** - language that is too sharp or too casual
- **Scope creep** - the agent tries to do more than you asked

**Simple guardrails**

- Use a **Green, Amber, Red** list for what can be pasted
- Keep a short **prompt log** for key actions
- Require a **sample before scale**
- Build a **review checklist** into the workflow
- Keep the **final decision** with you

**Teacher micro-script**

> "Stop if you need personal data. Produce a sample with generic class details. I will check accuracy and tone before we go further."

## 5) A 45-Minute Lesson You Can Copy Tomorrow

**Goal**: Students learn how to delegate a simple task to a classroom agent safely, then review and improve the result.

**Materials**: Projector or visualiser, mini whiteboards, timer, DARE cards, one generic agent prompt template.

### Plan

**Minutes 0-5: Hook**  
Show a messy prompt and a clean DARE-style prompt.  
**Micro-script**: "Which one will get a better result and why?"

**Minutes 5-12: Teach DARE**  
Define each step with one example.  
**Quick check**: students hold up the D, A, R, or E card to match the step you are modelling.

**Minutes 12-20: Worked Example**  
You delegate a safe task live, for example, "Create three retrieval questions on photosynthesis." Show sample first, then approve and edit.  
**Teacher move**: narrate your checks for accuracy and tone.

**Minutes 20-32: Guided Practice in Pairs**  
Pairs use the template to delegate a similar task, for example, "Create a model answer and one error spotter." They must request a sample first.  
**Teacher micro-script**:

> "Ask for a sample. If it passes the checks, ask for two more. If it fails, refine your Define step."

**Minutes 32-40: Whole-Class Feedback**  
On the board: **What worked**, **Common fixes**, **Next step**.  
Students add one edit to improve clarity or accuracy.

**Minutes 40-45: Exit Ticket**  
Students submit a short DARE prompt and the edit they made after review.

### Years 5-6 Variant

- Use concrete topics and sentence stems
- Provide a scaffolded template with tick boxes for the Define step
- Hinge question: "What made the sample safe to use?"

### Years 9-10 Variant

- Add a constraint like "two reading levels" or "include a counter-example"
- Require a bias check: students list one way the sample could be unfair and fix it

## 6) Ten Plug-and-Play Agent Tasks That Save Time

1. **Three model answers** at different levels for the same criterion
2. **Five retrieval questions** with answers
3. **A flawed example** for error hunting
4. **A mini checklist** for success criteria in student language
5. **Two hinge questions** that split the class by understanding
6. **A short, calm parent update template** with no names
7. **A vocabulary list** with friendly definitions
8. **A gallery walk set** with captions
9. **A quick writing frame** for explanations
10. **A whole-class feedback summary** after you share your notes

**Teacher micro-script**

> "Draft, do not decide. Keep it short. I will select and adapt."

## 7) Differentiation Without Extra Marking

Use **three scaffold levels** for the same goal.

- **High support**: worked example, sentence stems, one step at a time
- **Medium**: model plus checklist, two steps together
- **Light**: success criteria only, full attempt

**Move up a level in the lesson**

- After review, remove one scaffold and try again
- Celebrate the move, not the mark

### Mini-Rubric

**Delegates Safely**

- **Novice**: unclear goal or includes identifiers
- **Secure**: clear goal, generic data, sample requested
- **Strong**: precise goal, constraints stated, sample refined with evidence-based edits

**Checks Evidence**

- **Novice**: accepts the first output
- **Secure**: checks for accuracy and tone
- **Strong**: checks, justifies edits, and improves the model

## 8) Roadblocks and Quick Fixes

**Outputs feel generic**

- Add your success criteria and one local example
- Request three variants and choose the best fit

**Tone is off**

- Ask for calm, professional UK English
- Replace any loaded terms with neutral language

**Too much information**

- Set a hard word limit
- Ask for bullet points, not prose

**Students over-rely on drafts**

- Hide the model during independent work
- Use the model only for checking after a first attempt

**Safety is missed**

- Revisit Green, Amber, Red
- Add a pre-flight checklist to the Define step

## 9) How Zaza Helps Without Taking Over

- **Zara** - a consistent in-app assistant across Zaza products. Use Zara to run DARE prompts, generate example variants, and prepare quick checks
- **Zaza Promptly** - turn whole-class feedback into next steps, rewrite criteria in pupil-speak, prepare calm parent templates, and translate short notes
- **Safety habit** - keep sensitive data out of prompts. Review tone and accuracy before use

**Teacher micro-script**

> "Zara drafts. I decide. We keep student data out. We check before we share."

## Building Agent Confidence

The key to successful agent integration is starting with simple, safe tasks and building complexity gradually. Choose one DARE routine and use it consistently for a fortnight.

Students will initially be fascinated by agent capabilities. Channel this curiosity into learning about quality control and evidence evaluation rather than prompt optimisation.

Remember: agents amplify your teaching decisions, they don't make them. Your professional judgement about what works for your specific students remains central.

## Common Concerns About Agents

### "Won't agents make teaching impersonal?"

Not if you use them for drafting routine materials while focusing your human energy on relationships, discussion, and individual support.

### "How do I know agent outputs are accurate?"

You don't automatically. That's why the Review step in DARE is non-negotiable. Checking agents becomes a valuable critical thinking skill.

### "What about job security?"

Agents handle routine tasks so you can focus on the uniquely human aspects of teaching: building relationships, facilitating discussion, and making complex professional judgements.

### "This seems complicated to learn"

Start with one simple task. The DARE routine takes 5 minutes to learn and becomes automatic with practice.

## The Bigger Picture

AI agents in education aren't about replacing teachers or eliminating professional judgement. They're about handling routine cognitive tasks so teachers can focus on the irreplaceable human elements of education.

When agents draft model answers, you choose which ones best serve your students. When they suggest lesson structures, you adapt them to your classroom context. When they cluster student responses, you decide what the patterns mean.

The goal isn't efficiency for its own sake. It's sustainable teaching that maintains quality while reducing unsustainable workload.

## Looking Forward

Agent capabilities will develop rapidly over the next decade. The principles in this guide will remain constant: clear goals, human oversight, student safety, and teacher agency.

Build habits now with simple DARE routines. When more sophisticated agents emerge, you'll have the framework to evaluate and integrate them thoughtfully.

The question isn't whether agents will change education. It's whether teachers will shape how that change happens.

## Getting Started This Week

1. **Try one DARE delegation** from the list of ten plug-and-play tasks
2. **Practice the routine** with a simple example like creating retrieval questions
3. **Keep notes** about what works and what needs adjustment
4. **Teach the 45-minute lesson** to help students understand safe delegation

Each small step builds confidence and competence. Perfect implementation isn't required. Thoughtful, consistent practice is.

Your students will benefit from better resources and more targeted support. You'll benefit from time savings that you can reinvest in the human aspects of teaching.

## Classroom Assets You Can Copy

### Agent Readiness Checklist

- Clear goal, success criteria, generic data, sample first, review, edit, save

### DARE Prompt Template

- Fill in four lines and you are ready to delegate

### Parent or Leader Script

> "We use classroom agents to draft examples, checks, and templates. We do not paste personal information. A teacher reviews all outputs. This reduces workload and lets us spend more time on teaching and care."
