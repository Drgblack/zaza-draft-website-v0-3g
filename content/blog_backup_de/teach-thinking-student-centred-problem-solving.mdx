# Teach Thinking, Not Just Tasks: A Practical Framework for Student-Centred Problem-Solving

Picture this: your Year 8s have just finished a worksheet on ecosystems. Every answer is correct. They can define 'food chain' and label a diagram perfectly.

But when you ask, "Why might removing foxes from this habitat affect the entire system?" â€” silence.

They've completed the task. They haven't learned to think.

Sound familiar? You're not alone. Most lessons focus on content delivery rather than thinking development. Students become skilled at following instructions but struggle when problems require reasoning.

Here's the good news: you can change this without extra marking, complex resources, or overhauling your entire curriculum. What follows is a simple, research-backed pattern that builds critical thinking into any lesson. Your students will still cover the content. They'll just think more deeply about it.

## From My PhD: Key Takeaways

My research focused on critical thinking and problem-solving in student-centred eLearning environments. Here's what makes the biggest difference in classroom practice:

â€¢ **Authentic problems with clear success criteria improve transfer**: Students apply thinking skills better when they work on real-world problems with transparent expectations

â€¢ **Short, routine metacognitive prompts boost reasoning**: Simple "How do you know?" questions work better than complex reflection tasks

â€¢ **Worked examples followed by faded guidance reduce cognitive load**: Show the thinking process first, then gradually remove support

â€¢ **Peer dialogue plus teacher questioning outperforms worksheet practice**: Structured talk develops reasoning more effectively than silent work

â€¢ **Fast, formative feedback beats lengthy summative comments**: Quick checks and immediate course corrections trump detailed end-of-lesson feedback

## The THINK Framework

**T**ime the problem  
**H**ypothesise solutions  
**I**nvestigate evidence  
**N**egotiate meanings  
**K**now your reasoning

This five-step pattern works across subjects and age groups. Each step builds thinking skills while keeping cognitive load manageable.

### Step 1: Time the Problem (5 minutes)

**Purpose**: Activate prior knowledge and establish clear thinking goals.

**Teacher micro-script**: "We have 5 minutes to understand this problem. What do we already know? What do we need to find out? Turn to your partner and share your first thoughts."

**Student action**: Pairs discuss what they notice, what seems familiar, and what questions arise.

**Low-prep activity**: Problem gallery walk â€” display the challenge on paper around the room, students move and annotate with sticky notes.

**Check for understanding**: "Thumbs up if you can explain this problem to someone else. Thumbs sideways if you're getting there."

### Step 2: Hypothesise Solutions (8 minutes)

**Purpose**: Generate multiple possibilities before investigating, developing divergent thinking.

**Teacher micro-script**: "Now we brainstorm. All ideas welcome â€” we'll evaluate later. What might work here? What patterns do you recognise from similar problems?"

**Student action**: Individual brain dump (2 minutes), then share in groups of four, building on each other's ideas.

**Low-prep activity**: Hypothesis carousel â€” groups rotate around stations, adding solutions to different aspects of the problem.

**Check for understanding**: "Point to someone who shared an idea different from yours. Nod if you understand their thinking."

### Step 3: Investigate Evidence (15 minutes)

**Purpose**: Test hypotheses against available information, developing analytical skills.

**Teacher micro-script**: "Time to play detective. Which of our ideas have the strongest evidence? What information supports or challenges each hypothesis?"

**Student action**: Groups choose 2-3 hypotheses to test, gather evidence from provided sources, and prepare mini-presentations.

**Low-prep activity**: Evidence sorting â€” provide mixed information cards, students categorise by relevance to different hypotheses.

**Check for understanding**: "Show me the piece of evidence you found most surprising. Explain why it changed your thinking."

### Step 4: Negotiate Meanings (10 minutes)

**Purpose**: Compare interpretations and build consensus through reasoned argument.

**Teacher micro-script**: "Different groups may have reached different conclusions. That's good â€” it means you're thinking critically. Present your strongest argument and listen to others. What makes one explanation more convincing?"

**Student action**: Gallery walk of group findings, followed by structured debate using claim-evidence-reasoning format.

**Low-prep activity**: Standing debate â€” students physically move to show agreement/disagreement, must justify their position before moving.

**Check for understanding**: "Raise your hand if you've changed your mind about something. What evidence convinced you?"

### Step 5: Know Your Reasoning (7 minutes)

**Purpose**: Reflect on thinking processes and consolidate learning.

**Teacher micro-script**: "Let's step back from the content. How did we solve this? What thinking strategies worked best? When might you use this approach again?"

**Student action**: Individual reflection using sentence starters, then pair-share key insights.

**Low-prep activity**: Thinking strategy auction â€” students 'bid' on the most useful problem-solving approaches with play money.

**Check for understanding**: "Complete this sentence: 'Next time I face a similar problem, I will...'"

## A 45-Minute Lesson You Can Copy

**Materials needed**: Problem scenario, information sources (texts, images, data), sticky notes, timer

### Version A: Years 5-6 Primary

**Context**: "Should our school ban single-use plastic bottles?"

- **Time the Problem (5 mins)**: Students examine images of school waste, discuss what they notice
- **Hypothesise Solutions (8 mins)**: Brainstorm pros and cons of different policies
- **Investigate Evidence (15 mins)**: Research stations on health, environment, cost, and alternatives
- **Negotiate Meanings (10 mins)**: Mini-debate with evidence requirements
- **Know Your Reasoning (7 mins)**: Reflect on how they weighed different factors

### Version B: Years 9-10 Secondary

**Context**: "Why did the Roman Empire fall?"

- **Time the Problem (5 mins)**: Examine timeline and map, identify potential factors
- **Hypothesise Solutions (8 mins)**: Generate multiple causation theories
- **Investigate Evidence (15 mins)**: Source analysis of historical documents
- **Negotiate Meanings (10 mins)**: Historical argument construction and peer review
- **Know Your Reasoning (7 mins)**: Metacognitive reflection on historical thinking

**Subject variants**:

- **Science**: "How can we reduce plastic pollution in our local river?" (environmental chemistry)
- **English**: "Is social media changing how teenagers communicate?" (language analysis)
- **History**: "What factors led to the success of the suffragette movement?" (causation and significance)

## Formative Checks That Take Under 3 Minutes

Use these prompts to elicit reasoning, not just recall:

1. **"Walk me through your thinking"** â€” Gets students to verbalise their process
2. **"What evidence would change your mind?"** â€” Tests flexibility and bias awareness
3. **"How is this similar to/different from...?"** â€” Checks for pattern recognition
4. **"What assumptions are you making?"** â€” Develops metacognitive awareness
5. **"If you had to convince a sceptic, what would you say?"** â€” Strengthens argumentation
6. **"What would happen if...?"** â€” Assesses transfer and application

### Quick Assessment Rubric

| Skill                  | Novice             | Secure                   | Strong                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Uses Evidence**      | Lists information  | Links evidence to claims | Evaluates evidence quality         |
| **Explains Reasoning** | States conclusions | Shows logical steps      | Considers alternative perspectives |

## Common Pitfalls and Quick Fixes

### 1. Tasks Too Open

**Problem**: Students freeze when problems are completely unstructured.
**Fix**: Provide clear success criteria and thinking prompts. Offer choice within boundaries.

### 2. Cognitive Overload

**Problem**: Students try to process too much new information while learning to think critically.
**Fix**: Use familiar content when introducing new thinking skills. Build complexity gradually.

### 3. Silent Groups

**Problem**: Some students don't participate in discussions.
**Fix**: Use structured talk protocols. Assign rotating roles. Start with pair work before groups.

### 4. Vague Criteria

**Problem**: Students don't know what good reasoning looks like.
**Fix**: Show worked examples. Use visible thinking routines. Provide sentence starters for quality responses.

### 5. Feedback Arrives Too Late

**Problem**: By the time you give feedback, students have moved on mentally.
**Fix**: Use peer feedback systems. Check understanding during the lesson. Provide immediate verbal feedback to whole class.

## How AI Can Lighten the Load

Three practical ways to use AI tools like Zaza Draft safely and effectively:

### 1. Rewrite for Clarity and Tone

Paste your problem scenarios or instructions into an AI tool and ask it to simplify language for your year group. Check the output maintains academic rigour while improving accessibility.

### 2. Generate Example Variations

Use AI to create additional practice problems that follow the same thinking pattern. This saves preparation time while giving students more opportunities to apply the framework.

### 3. Translate Parent Updates

When sharing thinking-based learning approaches with families, use AI to help translate key concepts into accessible language or other languages, ensuring all parents understand the pedagogical approach.

## Building Thinking Habits

The THINK framework works best when used consistently. Start with one subject area and gradually extend to others. Students need repeated practice to internalise these thinking patterns.

Don't expect perfection immediately. Critical thinking develops over time through guided practice and supportive feedback. Celebrate small improvements in reasoning quality.

Remember: you're not adding extra content. You're changing how students interact with existing curriculum. This approach actually saves time by reducing the need for re-teaching when students understand concepts more deeply.

## Making It Sustainable

Begin with familiar lesson content so you can focus on the thinking processes rather than learning new subject matter. Once the pattern becomes routine, you can tackle more challenging topics.

Keep resources simple. The framework works with basic materials most classrooms already have. Complexity comes from the thinking, not expensive resources.

Build in reflection time for yourself too. Note which steps work well with your students and which need adjustment. The framework should serve your teaching, not constrain it.

## The Bigger Picture

Teaching thinking isn't just about academic achievement. Students who can analyse evidence, consider alternatives, and explain their reasoning become better citizens, employees, and decision-makers.

In our information-rich world, the ability to think critically about sources, claims, and solutions becomes more vital every day. By embedding these skills in everyday lessons, we prepare students for challenges we can't yet imagine.

The THINK framework gives you a practical starting point. Adapt it to your context, your students, and your teaching style. The goal isn't perfect implementation but consistent development of thinking habits.

Your students already complete tasks effectively. Now help them think about those tasks more deeply. The difference will show in their engagement, their questions, and their confidence when facing new problems.
