<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>AI can help teachers differentiate instructionÃ¢â‚¬"supporting students who need scaffolds, providing on-grade practice, and challenging advanced learners with extension tasksÃ¢â‚¬"without multiplying planning time. This guide gives you a concrete, repeatable routine you can use this week.</p>

<h2>Core ideas</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Differentiate the task, not the target:</strong> keep the same standard but vary supports, examples, and cognitive demand.</li>
  <li><strong>Use AI to draft, you to decide:</strong> let AI propose options; you choose and refine based on your students.</li>
  <li><strong>Tight prompts, tight outputs:</strong> tell the model audience, length, reading level, vocabulary, and success criteria.</li>
  <li><strong>Three lanes:</strong> <em>Entry</em> (below-grade scaffolds), <em>Core</em> (on-grade practice), <em>Stretch</em> (above-grade extension).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Micro case study</h2>
<p><strong>Case:</strong> Ms. Patel teaches 7th-grade science. Her class includes multilingual newcomers and two students ready for high-school biology content.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> One lab direction set and one worksheet never fit everyone; feedback took too long.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> She used a three-lane prompt to generate <em>Entry/Core/Stretch</em> versions and kept the same success criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> On a food-web assessment, the class median moved from 68% to 81% in three weeks; time spent on prep dropped 40%.</p>

<h2>Template pack</h2>
<pre><code>Prompt: Create three versions of the task "Energy Flow Lab":
- Entry (below-grade): short sentences, sentence starters, visuals, 5th-grade reading level.
- Core (on-grade): concise steps, grade-level vocabulary, one "explain your reasoning" item.
- Stretch (above-grade): open-ended extension, quantitative reasoning, transfer question.
For each version, include:
1) one-sentence goal,
2) numbered student steps,
3) one formative check (question),
4) success criteria aligned to the same standard.</code></pre>

<pre><code>Prompt: Draft a 5-criteria rubric for the "Ecosystems Lab":
Criteria: data collection, analysis, collaboration, safety, communication.
Levels: beginning, developing, proficient, exemplary.
Use student-facing language and specific descriptors.</code></pre>

<pre><code>Prompt: Generate five short formative quiz items on food webs.
For each, include:
- the correct answer,
- 2 distractors that reveal common misconceptions (e.g., "energy cycles").</code></pre>

<pre><code>Prompt: Write a parent-friendly two-paragraph summary of the unit goals
and one five-minute discussion question families can use at home.</code></pre>

<h2>For your classroom</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Pick one target:</strong> choose a single upcoming task (lab, reading, problem set) and define the success criteria.</li>
  <li><strong>Run the template:</strong> generate Entry/Core/Stretch drafts; keep tone, length, and reading level constraints.</li>
  <li><strong>Trim to fit:</strong> edit down to one page per lane; add your classroom examples and vocabulary.</li>
  <li><strong>Coach the move:</strong> teach students how to move from Entry Ã¢â€ ' Core Ã¢â€ ' Stretch using your rubric language.</li>
  <li><strong>Close the loop:</strong> give a 3-item exit ticket; use responses to place students for the next lesson.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Extended checklist</h2>
<ul>
  <li>State the same learning goal on all versions.</li>
  <li>Lower barriers first: decoding &amp; directions before content.</li>
  <li>Pre-teach 3Ã¢â‚¬"5 key words with examples and non-examples.</li>
  <li>Provide one worked example on Entry and one partial example on Core.</li>
  <li>On Stretch, ask for transfer to a novel context or numbers.</li>
  <li>Use one rubric across versions; change evidence, not criteria.</li>
  <li>Keep formative checks short and visible (one box at the bottom).</li>
  <li>Collect quick data (hands, cards, or 3-item quiz) to regroup next time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Three-lane task prompt (Entry/Core/Stretch)</li>
  <li>Student-facing 4-level lab rubric</li>
  <li>Vocabulary mini-cards (pictures + definitions)</li>
  <li>Sentence starters for explanations and claims</li>
  <li>Food-web misconception bank (common errors + fixes)</li>
  <li>Parent summary template (plain-language)</li>
  <li>Exit-ticket bundle (3-item formats)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final thought</h2>
<p>Differentiation is a design choice, not three different lessons. With tight prompts and one shared rubric, AI helps you build just-right on-ramps and true stretchÃ¢â‚¬"while you stay focused on feedback and relationships.</p>
