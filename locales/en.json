  "founder.journey.quote": "I built Zaza because I was tired of watching teachers drown in administrative work when technology should be setting them free.",
  "founder.journey.p1": "I started my career as a high school English teacher in 2008. Like most teachers, I loved working with students but struggled with the endless administrative tasks - parent emails, report cards, grading feedback. I'd spend my evenings and weekends writing when I should have been planning great lessons or spending time with my family.",
  "founder.journey.p2": "After earning my PhD in Educational Technology, I worked with schools implementing AI tools. But I kept seeing the same problem: generic AI tools weren't built for education. They'd invent student information, produce output that sounded nothing like a teacher, and create more work than they saved. Teachers needed something different.",
  "founder.journey.p3": "So in 2023, I founded Zaza Technologies with a simple mission: build AI tools that actually understand education. Tools trained on real pedagogy, not business writing. Tools that are hallucination-safe, FERPA-compliant, and designed from the ground up for teachers. Tools that respect teachers' expertise and give them their time back.",
  "founder.journey.p4": "Today, Zaza serves over 500 teachers across 15 countries, saving them 10+ hours per week. But we're just getting started. My vision is to build a complete suite of AI tools that help every teacher reclaim their time and focus on what matters most: their students.",

  "founder.personal.message1": "If you're reading this, you're probably a teacher who's curious about AI but skeptical about whether it can really help. I get it. I was skeptical too. Most AI tools feel like they were built by people who've never set foot in a classroom.",

  "about.founder.journey.subtitle": "From paint brushes in Tasmania to building AI for education.",
  "about.founder.journey.p1": "I began my working life in Hobart as a painter and decorator after my dad, who ran the local factory Tas Paints, used his contacts to get me into TAFE. There I completed a four-year apprenticeship. Truth be told, I hated it, it wasn't for me. But my dad's advice was simple: \\\"Son, just get your papers, and you can do anything you want.\\\" So I pushed through.",
  "about.founder.journey.p2": "That apprenticeship gave me more than just technical trade skills. It taught me the value of hard work, turning up every day, being reliable, and collaborating with others. Apprenticeships build skills that stay with you for life: communication, teamwork, problem-solving, adaptability, professionalism. Those lessons shaped how I later approached leadership, research, and building teams.",
  "about.founder.journey.p3": "But it also made me realise something important: this wasn't what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I wanted to learn more. So I packed a backpack and set off on a round-the-world journey. Along the way, I met people, tried new foods, and experienced different cultures.",
  "about.founder.journey.p4": "In Frankfurt, I enrolled in a Diploma of German and completed the degree. Somewhere on that journey, I had my epiphany: education is the key to my future. If I wanted to make something of myself, I needed to go back home, get into university, and build a new path.",
  "about.founder.journey.p5": "So I returned to Tasmania, applied to the University of Tasmania, and was delighted to be accepted.",
  "about.founder.journey.p6": "That turning point at the University of Tasmania set me on a new course. I discovered not only the power of education to transform my own life, but also a lifelong passion for understanding how people learn.",
  "about.founder.journey.p7": "I went on to study Administration, Information Systems, and German, earning First Class Honours. My research pulled me deeper into learning science, critical thinking, problem-solving, and student-centred approaches. Later, I completed a PhD by publication in Professional Education at City, University of London.",
  "about.founder.journey.p8": "For two decades in Learning & Development, I taught thousands of adults in real classrooms, designed learning programs, and led major initiatives. My PhD research focused on tech-supported, student-centered learning, exploring how to cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving skills. As Chief Learning Officer at Communardo, I now lead AI-powered learning design and LMS innovation across organizations. But through all of it, one truth held constant: I saw what works in education, what gets in the way, and why educators need tools that respect their expertise.",
  "about.founder.journey.p9": "I also stayed close to teachers in my own family and community. Listening to their struggles with parent emails, grading, and paperwork showed me the same patterns of overload. All necessary, but so consuming that it steals the time and energy teachers need most.",
