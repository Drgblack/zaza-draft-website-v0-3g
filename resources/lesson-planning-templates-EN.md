## Why This Matters

Good lesson planning shouldn't take two hours per lesson. But when you're staring at a blank template wondering how to fill all those boxes, it often does.

**The problem:** Generic lesson plan templates don't match how you actually teach. They force you into rigid structures that don't fit your content or your students.

**The solution:** Flexible templates based on proven instructional models - so you can plan efficiently while maintaining quality.

This guide gives you:

- **5 lesson plan templates** for different instructional approaches
- **Built-in differentiation** (not an afterthought)
- **Assessment checkpoints** (formative + summative)
- **Time estimates** (so you're not scrambling mid-lesson)
- **Editable formats** you can adapt to your content and grade level

> **Who this is for:** Teachers who want to plan purposefully without spending their weekends writing lesson plans, instructional coaches supporting teachers with planning, and anyone tired of templates that don't actually help.

## How to Choose Your Template

Different lessons need different structures. Here's how to decide:

| If your lesson goal is...                            | Use this template                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Introducing a new concept**                        | 5E Model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate)        |
| **Building a complex skill through practice**        | Workshop Model (Mini-lesson, Practice, Share)                   |
| **Teaching a clear procedure or fact-based content** | Direct Instruction (I Do, We Do, You Do)                        |
| **Fostering discussion and critical thinking**       | Socratic Seminar Model (Prep, Launch, Discuss, Debrief)         |
| **Facilitating student-driven inquiry**              | Problem-Based Learning (Question, Investigate, Create, Present) |

> **Pro Tip:** You don't need to use the same template every day. Mix and match based on your learning goals. Variety keeps students engaged and honors different learning styles.

## Bonus: Quick-Start Planning Guide

### Use This Checklist for Any Lesson

**Before Planning:**

- [ ] What's the learning objective? (One clear, measurable goal)
- [ ] What will students DO to show they learned it?
- [ ] What's my hook? (How will I grab their attention in the first 5 minutes?)

**During Planning:**

- [ ] Have I built in differentiation? (Scaffolds + extensions)
- [ ] Do I have a formative assessment checkpoint? (How will I know if they're getting it?)
- [ ] Is my timing realistic? (Add 5-10 minutes to every estimate)

**After Planning:**

- [ ] Can I explain this lesson in 2 sentences? (If not, it's too complicated)
- [ ] Have I prepared my materials? (Print, organize, test tech)
- [ ] Do I know what students will do if they finish early?

---

## FAQ

**Q: Do I have to fill out every section of these templates?**  
No. Use what's helpful. Skip what's not. These are frameworks, not mandates.

**Q: How do I choose the right template for my lesson?**  
Start with your learning goal. If you're teaching a skill, use Workshop or Direct Instruction. If you're teaching a concept, use 5E or PBL. If you're fostering discussion, use Socratic Seminar.

**Q: Can I mix templates within one lesson?**  
Absolutely. For example, you might start with a 5E Engage, then transition to a Workshop model for practice.

**Q: What if my school requires a specific format?**  
Adapt these. Copy the elements that work (differentiation, assessment, reflection) and plug them into your required template.

**Q: How detailed should my lesson plans be?**  
Detailed enough that a substitute could teach from them. But not so detailed you spend hours planning a single lesson.

**Q: How do I plan for pacing issues (too fast or too slow)?**  
Always have a backup task for early finishers and an "if we run out of time" plan. It's okay to adjust on the fly.

---

## Your Next Steps

### This Week (15-Minute Start):

1. **Choose ONE template** that fits a lesson you're teaching soon
2. **Fill in the basics** (objective, materials, activities)
3. **Teach it** and take notes on what worked

### This Month (Build Your Library):

- Save 3 templates you use most often in a folder
- Customize them with your school's logo, your name, your style
- Share with a colleague and get feedback

### This Year (Master Your Craft):

- Try all 5 templates at least once
- Reflect: Which one feels most natural to you?
- Build a "greatest hits" lesson plan library you can reuse

---

## Bonus: Digital vs. Paper Planning

**Digital Tools:**

- Google Docs (collaborative, cloud-based)
- Notion (visual, flexible)
- OneNote (organized by unit/subject)

**Paper Tools:**

- Lesson plan book (simple, no tech needed)
- Sticky notes (quick adjustments on the fly)
- Index cards (portable, easy to shuffle)

**Best Practice:** Use what works for YOU. Don't force yourself into a system that feels clunky.

---

## Closing Thoughts

Good lesson planning is about clarity, not perfection.

These templates aren't meant to add more work. They're meant to give you a starting point so you're not reinventing the wheel every time you plan.

Pick one. Try it. Adjust it. Make it yours.

And remember: Even the best lesson plan needs to be flexible. Sometimes the best teaching moments happen when you throw the plan out the window and follow your students' curiosity.

**You've got this - now go teach something amazing.** ðŸŽ“
