## Why This Matters Now

Your students are already using AI. ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and dozens of other tools are in their pockets. The question isn't "Should students use AI?" - they already are. The question is: **"How do we teach them to use it ethically, safely, and effectively?"**

Here's what this guide covers:
- **5 non-negotiable rules** for AI use in education
- **Student data privacy** essentials (what to never put into AI)
- **Academic integrity** guidelines (the difference between using AI and cheating)
- **Conversation starters** to discuss AI ethics with students
- **Classroom policy templates** you can adapt and share

> **Who this is for:** K-12 teachers who want to embrace AI as a learning tool while protecting student safety, privacy, and academic integrity.

## The 5 Non-Negotiable Rules for AI in Education

### Rule 1: Never Input Student Personal Information into AI Tools

**The Risk:** Most AI tools are not FERPA or COPPA compliant. Anything you put into ChatGPT, Gemini, or similar tools may be stored and used to train future models.

**What NOT to Put Into AI:**
- Student names, IDs, or email addresses
- Grade information or assessment scores
- IEP details or accommodation information
- Behavioral records or disciplinary notes
- Parent contact information
- Student work with identifying information (unless anonymized)

**Safe Alternative:**
- Use generic placeholders: "Student A," "a 7th grader," "my class"
- Remove all identifying details before inputting student work
- Use school-approved, FERPA-compliant AI tools if available

**Example:**
```
âŒ BAD: "Write feedback for John Smith's essay on climate change. He's 
an 8th grader with an IEP for ADHD."

âœ… GOOD: "Write feedback for an 8th grade essay on climate change. The 
student struggles with organization and would benefit from structured 
feedback."
```

### Rule 2: AI Assists, Humans Decide

**The Principle:** AI is a tool for brainstorming, drafting, and efficiency - NOT for making final decisions about students.

**What This Means:**
- âœ… Use AI to generate feedback drafts → YOU personalize and finalize
- âœ… Use AI to create assignment ideas → YOU adapt for your students
- âœ… Use AI to analyze patterns → YOU interpret and act
- âŒ Don't let AI grade student work without your review
- âŒ Don't use AI-generated reports without personalizing them
- âŒ Don't rely on AI to make placement or intervention decisions

**Why It Matters:** AI doesn't know your students. It doesn't see the context, the growth, or the humanity. You do.

---

### Rule 3: Transparency is Non-Negotiable

**The Principle:** If you use AI, tell students (and parents).

**Why Transparency Matters:**
- Builds trust with students and families
- Models ethical AI use
- Allows students to opt out if they're uncomfortable
- Protects you legally and professionally

**How to Be Transparent:**

**Option 1: Course Syllabus Statement**
```
"In this class, I may use AI tools (like ChatGPT or Grammarly) to help 
me create resources, provide feedback drafts, or generate discussion 
prompts. All AI-generated content is reviewed and personalized by me 
before sharing with students. If you have questions or concerns about 
AI use, please contact me."
```

**Option 2: Email/Newsletter to Parents**
```
Subject: How We're Using AI as a Learning Tool This Year

Dear Families,

This year, I'm exploring AI tools to help me work more efficiently - 
which means more time for your students. Here's how I'm using it:
- Generating first drafts of feedback (I personalize every comment)
- Creating differentiated resources for different learning levels
- Brainstorming creative lesson ideas

I never input student names, grades, or personal information into AI. 
All final decisions about your child's learning are made by me, not a 
machine. Questions? I'm happy to discuss!
```

### Rule 4: Teach Students the Difference Between "Using" and "Cheating"

**The Challenge:** Students don't always know where the line is.

**The Solution:** Create clear, specific guidelines.

**AI Use Spectrum (Share This with Students):**

| âœ… ALLOWED | âš ï¸ ASK FIRST | âŒ NOT ALLOWED |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Brainstorming ideas | Getting feedback on drafts | Having AI write your entire essay |
| Checking grammar/spelling | Asking AI to explain a concept | Copying AI-generated text without citation |
| Outlining structure | Using AI to create a study guide | Using AI during tests/quizzes (unless approved) |
| Translating vocabulary | Asking AI to simplify complex text | Claiming AI work as your own |

**Classroom Policy Template:**
```
AI POLICY FOR [YOUR CLASS]

1. You may use AI for brainstorming, outlining, and editing.
2. You may NOT use AI to write assignments for you.
3. If you use AI to help with any assignment, you must:
   - Include an "AI Use Statement" explaining HOW you used it
   - Example: "I used ChatGPT to brainstorm 3 thesis ideas. I chose 
     one and wrote the essay myself."
4. If you're unsure whether your AI use is okay, ASK FIRST.
5. Violation = academic integrity violation (same as plagiarism).
```

### Rule 5: Address Bias and Misinformation

**The Reality:** AI is trained on internet data - which includes bias, misinformation, and outdated information.

**What Students Need to Know:**
- AI can be confident and wrong at the same time
- AI reflects biases from its training data (racial, gender, cultural)
- AI doesn't always cite sources or provide accurate information
- AI is a starting point, not a final answer

**How to Teach This:**

**Activity 1: The AI Fact-Check Challenge**
- Have students ask AI a factual question in your subject area
- Students fact-check the AI's response using credible sources
- Discuss: When was AI accurate? When did it hallucinate or mislead?

**Activity 2: Bias Detection**
- Ask AI to describe "a successful scientist" or "a great leader"
- Analyze the response: What assumptions did AI make? What's missing?
- Discuss: How can we recognize and challenge AI bias?

## Student Data Privacy Checklist

Before using ANY AI tool, ask yourself:

**FERPA Compliance:**
- â˜ Is this tool approved by my district?
- â˜ Does the tool have a data privacy policy?
- â˜ Am I anonymizing all student information?

**COPPA Compliance (for students under 13):**
- â˜ Does this tool require parental consent?
- â˜ Am I sharing student work without identifiers?

**Your Professional Protection:**
- â˜ Have I documented how I'm using AI?
- â˜ Have I informed admin/parents about my AI use?
- â˜ Am I following district policy on educational technology?

> **Pro Tip:** If your district doesn't have an AI policy yet, they will soon. Document everything you're doing now so you can show you've been responsible and thoughtful.

## Academic Integrity: Conversation Starters for Students

### Conversation #1: Why Does Academic Integrity Matter?

**The Hook:** "Would you trust a doctor who cheated through med school?"

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Integrity builds real skills (you'll need those skills in real life)
- Your reputation matters (colleges, employers, references)
- Learning is the goal, not the grade
- AI is a tool, not a shortcut to avoid learning

**Discussion Question:** "If AI can write essays in seconds, why do we still assign them? What's the point?"

**Answer:** Because writing teaches you to think, organize ideas, and communicate. The essay is the practice field. AI can't make you a better thinker - only practice can.

---

### Conversation #2: What's the Real Risk of AI Cheating?

**The Reality Check:** "We can tell when you use AI."

**How Teachers Spot AI:**
- Voice changes suddenly (your writing has a personality - AI doesn't)
- Vocabulary that's too advanced or formal for your level
- Generic content with no personal examples
- Perfect grammar but vague ideas
- Inconsistent citation styles

**Plus:** AI detection tools are improving (Turnitin, GPTZero, Originality.ai).

**The Message:** "It's not worth the risk. If you're struggling, ask for help. If you're overwhelmed, ask for an extension. Those are always better options than cheating."

---

### Conversation #3: How Can You Use AI Responsibly?

**Frame It Positively:** AI is a superpower if you use it right.

**Responsible AI Use Examples:**

**Scenario 1: You're Stuck on a Topic**
- âŒ Ask AI to write the essay
- âœ… Ask AI to brainstorm 5 possible angles on the topic, then YOU choose and develop one

**Scenario 2: You Don't Understand the Assignment**
- âŒ Copy AI's explanation and submit it
- âœ… Ask AI to explain it in simpler terms, then ask your teacher if you understood correctly

**Scenario 3: You're Editing Your Work**
- âŒ Let AI rewrite your sentences
- âœ… Ask AI to identify weak spots, then YOU improve them in your own voice

**The Rule:** AI should help you think better, not think for you.

## Classroom AI Policy Template (Editable)

```
AI USE POLICY FOR [CLASS NAME]

As your teacher, I believe AI is a tool that can help you learn - 
when used responsibly. Here's our class policy:

WHEN YOU CAN USE AI:
âœ“ Brainstorming ideas for projects or essays
âœ“ Generating practice quiz questions
âœ“ Checking grammar and spelling
âœ“ Explaining difficult concepts (after trying to understand on your own)
âœ“ Creating study guides or flashcards

WHEN YOU CANNOT USE AI:
âœ- Writing full essays, reports, or assignments
âœ- Completing homework problems without understanding the work
âœ- During tests, quizzes, or in-class assignments (unless I say otherwise)
âœ- Any time I specifically say "No AI on this assignment"

REQUIRED: AI USE STATEMENT
If you use AI on any assignment, you must include a statement like this:

"I used [AI tool name] to [specific task]. I reviewed the output and 
made my own decisions about how to use it."

CONSEQUENCES:
Using AI without disclosure or using it to complete work for you will be 
treated as an academic integrity violation (same as plagiarism).

QUESTIONS?
If you're not sure whether your use of AI is okay, ask me FIRST. 
I'd rather answer 100 questions than see you make a mistake.
```

## FAQ: Teacher Edition

**Q: Should I ban AI entirely?**  
No. Students will use it anyway. Better to teach them to use it responsibly and give them safe practice under your guidance.

**Q: What if my district doesn't have an AI policy?**  
Create your own classroom policy (use the template above) and share it with admin. Be transparent, document everything, and focus on student safety.

**Q: What AI tools ARE safe for students?**  
Check with your district IT department. Some schools approve tools like Google's Gemini for Education, Microsoft's Copilot for Education, or Khan Academy's Khanmigo because they have student data protections built in.

**Q: How do I grade assignments if I suspect AI use?**  
Have a conversation first. Ask the student to explain their process. Often, you'll learn they used AI inappropriately out of confusion, not malice. Use it as a teaching moment.

**Q: What about students with IEPs or 504s who need AI as an accommodation?**  
Assistive technology (like text-to-speech, speech-to-text, or Grammarly) is different from using AI to generate content. Always honor accommodations. If there's a gray area, consult your special education team.

## Closing Thoughts

AI isn't going away. In fact, it's going to become more powerful and more integrated into daily life. Our job as educators is to prepare students to use it wisely, ethically, and critically.

**You don't have to be an AI expert to teach AI ethics.** You just have to be honest, thoughtful, and willing to learn alongside your students.

The students who learn to use AI responsibly will have a massive advantage in college and careers. The students who don't will struggle. This is our chance to make a difference.

**Teach them to use the tool. But more importantly, teach them to think.** ðŸ§
