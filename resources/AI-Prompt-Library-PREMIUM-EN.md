## Why This Matters

You've heard AI can help teachers. But when you try it, you get generic responses that don't fit your students, your voice, or your situation. The difference between frustration and transformation? **How you ask.**

This library gives you battle-tested prompts that:
- Generate responses in **under 30 seconds** (not 30 minutes of trial-and-error)
- Match **your teaching style and voice**
- Are **ready to use right now** (just fill in the blanks)
- Actually **save you time** instead of creating more work

> **Who this is for:** K-12 teachers, teacher-leaders, instructional coaches, and anyone who writes parent emails, student feedback, or lesson plans—and wants to do it faster without sacrificing quality.

## The Anatomy of a Great Prompt

Before we dive into templates, here's the framework that makes prompts work:

### The 4-Part Formula

**1. ROLE** – Tell the AI who to act as
- ✅ "Act as a 7th-grade science teacher with 10 years of experience"
- ❌ "You are a teacher"

**2. TASK** – State exactly what you want
- ✅ "Draft a 150-word email to a parent about missing homework"
- ❌ "Write something about homework"

**3. CONSTRAINTS** – Set boundaries (tone, length, reading level)
- ✅ "Keep it under 180 words, professional but warm, reading level: 8th grade"
- ❌ "Make it good"

**4. INPUTS** – Provide context (paste student work, rubric, or details)
- ✅ "Context: Student has missed 4/6 assignments, but participates well in class"
- ❌ No context given

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Start with role + task + one constraint. Review the output. Then add more constraints to refine. Don't try to write the perfect prompt on your first attempt.

### Quick Example

**Bad prompt:**
> "Write an email to a parent"

**Good prompt:**
> "Act as a 5th-grade teacher. Draft a calm, professional email (under 150 words) to a parent about their child missing 3 homework assignments this week. Include: 1) what was missed, 2) two specific next steps, and 3) one encouraging statement about the student's participation in class. Keep the tone collaborative, not accusatory."

**Why it works:** The AI knows who you are, what you need, how long it should be, what to include, and what tone to use.

## Part 1: Parent Communication Prompts

### 1.1 The Supportive Concern Email

**Use when:** A student is struggling academically or missing work, and you want to partner with parents without sounding accusatory.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Act as a [grade level] [subject] teacher. Draft a calm, supportive email to a parent about [student name] [specific issue: missing assignments / struggling with concept / change in behavior].

Include:
- Brief factual description (2-3 sentences)
- 2 specific next steps (one for home, one for school)
- 1 sentence highlighting a student strength
- Invitation to discuss further

Tone: Professional, collaborative, solution-focused
Length: 120-180 words
```

**Fill-in-the-blanks version:**
```
Act as a [7th-grade math] teacher. Draft a calm, supportive email to a parent about [Alex] [missing 4 homework assignments in the past 2 weeks].

Include:
- Brief factual description (2-3 sentences)
- 2 specific next steps (one for home, one for school)
- 1 sentence highlighting a student strength
- Invitation to discuss further

Tone: Professional, collaborative, solution-focused
Length: 120-180 words
```

**Sample Output:**
> Dear Mr. and Mrs. Johnson,
>
> I'm reaching out about Alex's recent homework completion. Over the past two weeks, Alex has not submitted 4 of the 6 assigned practice problems, which makes it harder to master the concepts we're building toward.
>
> To support Alex, could we work together on these steps?
> 1. **At home:** Help Alex set aside 20 minutes after dinner for homework, even if it's just reviewing notes.
> 2. **At school:** I'll check in with Alex at the start of each class to confirm they understand the assignment.
>
> I want to note that Alex participates thoughtfully during lessons and grasps concepts quickly when engaged. Let's build on that strength.
>
> Would you be available for a brief phone call this week to discuss further? I'm confident we can turn this around together.
>
> Best regards,  
> Ms. Thompson
