## Why This Matters

It's report card season. You have 90 comments to write, a deadline looming, and every blank comment box feels like writer's block.

You want to write something meaningful - not generic. But you also don't have 6 hours to craft poetic paragraphs about every student's learning journey.

**The problem:** Writing 90 unique, professional, specific comments takes forever. And by student #47, they all start to sound the same.

**The solution:** A comment bank - pre-written templates you can mix, match, and customize in seconds.

This guide gives you:
- **50+ comment stems** organized by subject and achievement level
- **Mix-and-match templates** (strength + growth + next step)
- **Tone variations** (encouraging, direct, celebratory, concerned)
- **Differentiation tips** for special education, ELL, and gifted students
- **AI prompts** to speed up comment writing even more

> **Who this is for:** Any teacher writing report cards, progress reports, or narrative assessments who wants to be specific and professional without sacrificing their weekend.

## The Anatomy of a Great Report Card Comment

Before you grab a template, here's what makes a comment valuable to parents and students:

### The 3-Part Formula

**1. SPECIFIC OBSERVATION** (Not "working hard" - what are they actually doing?)
- âœ… "Maya consistently contributes thoughtful ideas during class discussions"
- âŒ "Maya is a good student"

**2. EVIDENCE OR CONTEXT** (What skill or growth does this show?)
- âœ… "demonstrating strong comprehension of complex texts"
- âŒ "she tries hard"

**3. NEXT STEP** (Where are they going? What's the focus?)
- âœ… "To continue growing, Maya should work on supporting her claims with direct textual evidence."
- âŒ "Keep up the good work!"

> **Pro Tip:** Parents can tell when you're copy-pasting. Vary your language. Use different sentence structures. Add one specific detail per student (a project, a moment, a strength).

---

## How to Use This Comment Bank

### Step 1: Identify the Achievement Level
Choose the section that matches the student's performance:
- **Exceeding Expectations:** Student is working above grade level
- **Meeting Expectations:** Student is on track
- **Approaching Expectations:** Student is making progress but needs support
- **Below Expectations:** Student needs significant intervention

### Step 2: Pick Your Template Type
- **Strength + Growth:** Highlight what's going well, then name the next step
- **Concern + Support:** Name the challenge and what you're doing to help
- **Celebration:** Pure positive (for strong performers or end-of-year wrap-ups)
- **Targeted Growth:** Focus entirely on skill development

### Step 3: Customize
- Add the student's name
- Insert a specific example (project, test, discussion moment)
- Adjust pronouns (he/she/they)
- Add one personal touch

### Step 4: Vary Your Language
Don't use the same stem for every student. Mix and match. Use synonyms. Change the structure.

## FAQ

**Q: Will parents know I used a template?**  
Not if you customize it. Add the student's name, a specific example, and adjust the wording. Parents care about specificity, not originality.

**Q: How do I write comments for students I barely know?**  
Use data (grades, test scores, observation notes) and ask yourself: What's one thing I've noticed? What's one thing they could improve? That's your comment.

**Q: What if I have 120 students?**  
Batch by performance level. Write all "exceeding" comments first, then "meeting," and so on. Use AI prompts to speed up drafts.

**Q: Can I be honest about behavior issues?**  
Yes - but frame it constructively. Instead of "disruptive," try "learning to manage [his/her/their] energy and focus in class." Include what you're doing to support them.

**Q: How do I write comments for students with IEPs?**  
Focus on progress toward IEP goals. Be positive but honest. Collaborate with the special education team if needed.
