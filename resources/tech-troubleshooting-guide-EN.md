## Why Tech Always Breaks at the Worst Time

It's 8:03 AM. Your students are settling in. You're about to start your meticulously planned digital lesson. You click the projector... nothing. You check the WiFi... no connection. You open your LMS... error message.

Tech failures are inevitable. But panic doesn't have to be.

This guide gives you:
- **Quick fixes** for the 10 most common classroom tech problems
- **A 1-page troubleshooting flowchart** to diagnose issues fast
- **Backup plans** so you never lose a lesson to tech failure
- **IT support templates** to get help quickly and clearly

> **Who this is for:** K-12 teachers who need tech to work - but don't have time to become IT experts when it doesn't.

## The Golden Rule: Always Have a Plan B

**Before we troubleshoot anything, establish this mindset:**

Every tech-based lesson should have a non-tech backup. Period.

**Examples:**
- Digital presentation? Print key slides.
- Online activity? Have a paper-based version.
- Video lesson? Have discussion questions ready.
- Digital quiz? Keep a paper version on hand.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Keep a "Tech Fail Toolkit" in your desk - printed resources, markers, paper, activities that work without WiFi. You'll use it more than you think.

## The 10 Most Common Tech Problems (And Fast Fixes)

### Problem 1: Projector Won't Turn On

**Symptoms:** No light, no image, no response from remote

**Quick Fixes (Try in this order):**

1. **Check the power cable** - Is it plugged in? Is the outlet working? (Sounds obvious, but it's often the culprit.)

2. **Try the manual power button** - The remote might be dead. Look for a physical button on the projector itself.

3. **Wait 2 minutes, try again** - Some projectors have a cooldown period. If someone just used it, it might need a rest.

4. **Check the lamp** - If the projector is old, the bulb might be dead. Look for a flashing red light (often means lamp failure).

**If none of this works:**
- Use your backup plan (printed slides, whiteboard, document camera)
- Submit IT ticket: "Projector in Room [X] not powering on. Checked power cable and manual button. Need replacement bulb or service."

---

### Problem 2: Projector is On But Screen is Blank

**Symptoms:** Projector light is on, but no image on screen

**Quick Fixes:**

1. **Check the input source** - Press "Source" or "Input" button on remote. Cycle through HDMI 1, HDMI 2, VGA, etc. Your laptop might be on a different input.

2. **Check your laptop display settings** - On Windows: Press `Windows + P`, choose "Duplicate" or "Extend." On Mac: System Preferences → Displays → Detect Displays.

3. **Reconnect the HDMI/VGA cable** - Unplug and replug both ends. Sometimes it's just a loose connection.

4. **Try a different cable** - If you have a spare HDMI or VGA cable, swap it out.

**If none of this works:**
- Use your backup plan
- IT ticket: "Projector in Room [X] not displaying image. Checked input source and cables. Laptop display settings correct. Need troubleshooting."

---

### Problem 3: No WiFi Connection

**Symptoms:** Can't connect to school network, or connected but no internet

**Quick Fixes:**

1. **Turn WiFi off and back on** - On your device, toggle airplane mode on/off or disconnect and reconnect to WiFi.

2. **Forget the network and reconnect** - Go to WiFi settings, "Forget" the school network, then reconnect and re-enter the password.

3. **Check if others have WiFi** - Ask students or a colleague. If it's widespread, it's a network issue (not your device).

4. **Restart your device** - Classic fix. Turn it off, wait 10 seconds, turn it back on.

**If none of this works:**
- Switch to offline activities (PDFs, downloaded videos, paper-based tasks)
- IT ticket: "No WiFi connection in Room [X]. Restarted device and reconnected to network. Students also affected. Need network check."

---

### Problem 4: Student Devices Won't Connect to WiFi

**Symptoms:** Your WiFi works, but student Chromebooks/iPads won't connect

**Quick Fixes:**

1. **Have students restart their devices** - 90% of the time, this fixes it.

2. **Check if they're on the right network** - Students sometimes connect to a guest network or neighboring building's WiFi.

3. **Check for profile/login issues** - Some districts require a login profile. Make sure students are logged in correctly.

4. **Try a different device** - If one device won't connect but others do, it's a device issue (not network-wide).

**If none of this works:**
- Pair struggling students with those who have working devices
- IT ticket: "Multiple student devices in Room [X] can't connect to WiFi. Network is [name]. Devices restarted and on correct network. Need support."

---

### Problem 5: LMS (Learning Management System) Won't Load

**Symptoms:** Google Classroom, Canvas, Schoology, etc. shows error or loading forever

**Quick Fixes:**

1. **Check if it's a site-wide issue** - Go to downdetector.com or ask colleagues. Sometimes the platform is down for everyone.

2. **Clear your browser cache** - Go to Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data. Select "Cached images and files."

3. **Try a different browser** - If Chrome isn't working, try Edge, Safari, or Firefox.

4. **Log out and log back in** - Sometimes your session expires. Log out, close the browser, open it again, and log back in.

**If none of this works:**
- Use email or Google Drive to share resources temporarily
- IT ticket: "LMS [name] not loading in Room [X]. Cleared cache, tried different browser, and logged out/in. Need assistance."

---

### Problem 6: Sound Not Working

**Symptoms:** Video plays but no audio, or audio is too quiet

**Quick Fixes:**

1. **Check your volume** - Laptop volume AND projector/speaker volume. Both need to be up.

2. **Unmute the video** - Many videos start muted. Look for a mute icon and click it.

3. **Check audio output settings** - Your laptop might be sending audio to the wrong output (internal speakers vs. HDMI/external speakers). On Windows: Right-click sound icon → Playback devices. On Mac: System Preferences → Sound → Output.

4. **Reconnect the audio cable** - If using a separate audio cable (3.5mm jack), unplug and replug it.

**If none of this works:**
- Use subtitles/closed captions if available
- IT ticket: "No audio output in Room [X]. Checked volume, output settings, and cables. Need speaker/audio troubleshooting."

---

### Problem 7: Can't Print

**Symptoms:** Printer offline, print job stuck, or nothing prints

**Quick Fixes:**

1. **Check if the printer is on** - Look for lights, paper jam, or low toner message.

2. **Cancel and resend the print job** - Go to your print queue, cancel all jobs, and send again.

3. **Restart the printer** - Turn it off, wait 10 seconds, turn it back on.

4. **Check printer connection** - If it's a network printer, make sure it's connected to WiFi. If it's USB, check the cable.

**If none of this works:**
- Print at a different location (main office, library)
- IT ticket: "Printer in Room [X] not responding. Restarted printer and resent job. Need service."

---

### Problem 8: Video Won't Play

**Symptoms:** Video buffering, error message, or frozen screen

**Quick Fixes:**

1. **Refresh the page** - Close and reopen the video. Sometimes it's just a loading glitch.

2. **Lower the video quality** - On YouTube, click the gear icon and select 480p or 360p (instead of HD). Lower quality = faster loading.

3. **Try a different browser** - If Safari isn't loading the video, try Chrome.

4. **Download the video ahead of time** - If you know WiFi is spotty, download videos before class (YouTube Premium, Vimeo, or screen record them).

**If none of this works:**
- Switch to a reading or discussion activity
- IT ticket: "Video playback issues in Room [X]. Tried different browsers and lowered quality. WiFi connection seems slow. Need network check."

---

### Problem 9: Smart Board/Interactive Display Not Responding

**Symptoms:** Touch screen not working, pen not writing, or display frozen

**Quick Fixes:**

1. **Recalibrate the touch screen** - Look for a calibration tool in the Smart Board software (usually in settings or tools menu).

2. **Check USB connection** - The Smart Board connects to your laptop via USB. Make sure it's plugged in and secure.

3. **Restart the Smart Board software** - Close the app and reopen it.

4. **Restart your laptop** - Sometimes the laptop loses connection to the board.

**If none of this works:**
- Use the board as a regular projector (still displays images, just no touch features)
- IT ticket: "Smart Board in Room [X] not responding to touch. Recalibrated, checked USB, and restarted software. Need troubleshooting."

---

### Problem 10: Student Device is Frozen/Unresponsive

**Symptoms:** Chromebook, iPad, or laptop stuck on loading screen or won't respond

**Quick Fixes:**

1. **Force restart** - Hold down the power button for 10 seconds until it shuts off. Wait 5 seconds, turn it back on.

2. **Check for updates** - Sometimes devices freeze during an update. Let it finish (this can take 10-15 minutes).

3. **Try a different student login** - If one student's profile is causing issues, have them log in on a different device to see if the problem persists.

**If none of this works:**
- Have the student share a device with a partner
- IT ticket: "Student device [ID or asset number] frozen in Room [X]. Force restarted multiple times. Need device swap or repair."

## Preventative Maintenance (Avoid Problems Before They Start)

### Weekly Checks:
- **Test your projector** on Monday morning before students arrive
- **Download key videos** ahead of time (don't rely on WiFi)
- **Charge all devices** (laptop, document camera, clicker) over the weekend

---

### Monthly Checks:
- **Update your laptop** - Run software updates during planning periods (not during class!)
- **Clean your tech** - Wipe down your keyboard, mouse, and projector remote
- **Check cables** - Look for fraying or loose connections

---

### Start of Year:
- **Submit a preemptive IT ticket** - Ask IT to check all equipment in your room before school starts
- **Request backup equipment** - Ask for a spare HDMI cable, VGA adapter, or extension cord to keep in your room

---

## Tech Fail Backup Activities (No WiFi/Tech Needed)

Keep these ideas in your back pocket:

1. **Think-Pair-Share** - Pose a question, students discuss in pairs, share out
2. **Whiteboard Practice** - Write problems/prompts on the board, students solve in notebooks
3. **Socratic Seminar** - Text-based discussion (print the text ahead of time)
4. **Gallery Walk** - Post chart paper around the room, students rotate and respond
5. **Exit Ticket** - Quick written reflection on today's topic (paper + pencil)

---

## When to Call for Help (vs. Troubleshoot Yourself)

### DIY It:
- Loose cables
- Volume issues
- Display input settings
- Simple restarts

### Call IT:
- Network outages
- Broken hardware (cracked screen, dead battery)
- Software installation/licensing issues
- Security/login problems

**Rule of Thumb:** If you've tried 3 fixes and it's still not working, call IT. Don't waste 30 minutes of class time troubleshooting.

## FAQ

**Q: What if IT takes days to respond?**  
Escalate to your admin. If it's impacting your ability to teach, it's urgent. Also, use the template above to be specific - vague tickets get slower responses.

**Q: What if students break devices on purpose?**  
Document it (date, time, what happened) and report to admin. This is a behavior issue, not just a tech issue.

**Q: What if I don't know the model/brand of my equipment?**  
Take a photo and include it in your IT ticket. Or describe it: "ceiling-mounted projector in Room 204."

**Q: What if I'm scared of breaking something by trying to fix it?**  
You won't. Unplugging a cable, restarting a device, or checking settings won't cause damage. If you're unsure, ask IT - but most "fixes" are safe.

## Your Next Steps

### This Week:
1. Test all your tech on Monday morning (5 minutes before students arrive)
2. Create a "Tech Fail Toolkit" (printed backup activities, spare cables)
3. Bookmark this guide on your laptop for easy access

### This Month:
- Submit an IT ticket for any equipment that's "kind of working but not great"

## Closing Thoughts

Tech is amazing when it works - and infuriating when it doesn't. But you're not helpless. With quick fixes, backup plans, and clear communication to IT, you can handle 90% of tech problems without losing instructional time.

**Remember: You're a teacher, not an IT specialist.** Do what you can, then move on. Your students need you teaching, not troubleshooting for 20 minutes.

**When tech fails, you don't. Keep teaching.** 🛠️
